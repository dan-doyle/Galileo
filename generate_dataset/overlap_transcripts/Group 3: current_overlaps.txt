00:13.2 <- poor quality audio
Speaker 1: Because the most important thing probably is to stay warm.
Speaker 2: It has no fluid.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you can use it still with the flint to start a fire.
Speaker 1: So, if you can get wood together then.
Speaker 2: Okay.

00:20.9 <- backchannel
Speaker 1: What about you?
Speaker 2: I did, uh, flashlight and batteries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I'm a chicken, so.
Speaker 1: Mhm.

00:30.5 <- backchannel, not a question
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 1: I put that one as number five.
Speaker 1: Mainly cause like if you have a fire going like I'm not sure if it would be -- I guess it would be better to move at night cause you'd stay warmer then cause that's when it's colder.
Speaker 2: Yep.

00:36.7 <- no overlap
Speaker 1: Mainly cause like if you have a fire going like I'm not sure if it would be -- I guess it would be better to move at night cause you'd stay warmer then cause that's when it's colder.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: But if you have a fire going then you could probably just sleep at night and you wouldn't need the flashlight, but.

00:42.4 <- no overlap
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: But if you have a fire going then you could probably just sleep at night and you wouldn't need the flashlight, but.
Speaker 2: Mhm.

00:49.7 <- unclear in audio
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 2: I obviously don't know much about lighters because I wasn't even thinking about the flint.
Speaker 1: [laughter]
Speaker 2: So that was my fourteenth choice [laughter].
Speaker 1: Mhm.

00:54.5 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: So that was my fourteenth choice [laughter].
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 2: But I agree with you with the cigarette lighter.
Speaker 2: If you can use that for fire then yeah.
Speaker 1: Mhm.

00:57.5 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: But I agree with you with the cigarette lighter.
Speaker 2: If you can use that for fire then yeah.
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 2: Kinda changes everything that I put actually.
Speaker 1: Mhm.

01:13.8 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, then your second choice?
Speaker 1: Um, I said the knife.
Speaker 2: I did extra shirts and pants just so it was another layer on your body.
Speaker 1: Okay.

01:30.3 <- no overlap
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: For me like my reasoning was like I kinda listed everything in order of stuff you could possibly build a fire with.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: And then after that I moved onto stuff like that.

01:38.4 <- interruption concerning content, accept argument
Speaker 1: And then after that I moved onto stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So that one's lower on my list.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: Like it's still important cause like you wanna change your layers so you aren't cold if you get sweaty.
Speaker 2: No totally agree.

01:42.4 <- perfect example of backchannel
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: Like it's still important cause like you wanna change your layers so you aren't cold if you get sweaty.
Speaker 2: No totally agree.
Speaker 2: Just because with mine, I had it backwards because I was -- no I didn't have a fire at that point [laughter] so.
Speaker 1: Mhm.

01:54.6 <- no overlap
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so.
Speaker 1: What do you think, do you think that's?
Speaker 2: No cause the knife is, well, even if there's animals or whatever, it's-it's some sort of protection right.

01:59.5 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so.
Speaker 1: What do you think, do you think that's?
Speaker 2: No cause the knife is, well, even if there's animals or whatever, it's-it's some sort of protection right.
Speaker 1: Mhm.

02:12.5 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: No cause the knife is, well, even if there's animals or whatever, it's-it's some sort of protection right.
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 2: Um, okay, third I put compass, but it would probably be better to have like either newspaper or rope or something because it's a dual purpose if you can light it and you can --
Speaker 1: Mhm.

02:19.5 <- no overlap
Speaker 2: Um, okay, third I put compass, but it would probably be better to have like either newspaper or rope or something because it's a dual purpose if you can light it and you can --
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I -- for me, for number three, I put the map.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: So -- cause -- and then after that I put the compass.

02:22.1 <- no overlap
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I -- for me, for number three, I put the map.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: So -- cause -- and then after that I put the compass.
Speaker 2: Mhm.

02:51.6 <- laughter not a turn
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 1: And the flashlight and the steel wool you could start a fire with.
Speaker 1: Cause like if you put batteries on steel wool it like creates a fire.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna die if I ever crash [laughter].
Speaker 1: [laughter]

03:20.9 <- interruption concerning content (adds detail despite being already mentioned)
Speaker 1: Hm, sure we can do the fire first.
Speaker 2: Okay, so which one?
Speaker 2: Wool, rope, um, or alcohol?
Speaker 1: Um, well, the newspaper also, we can use that one, too.
Speaker 2: And the -- or the newspaper.

03:24.2 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: Wool, rope, um, or alcohol?
Speaker 1: Um, well, the newspaper also, we can use that one, too.
Speaker 2: And the -- or the newspaper.
Speaker 2: The rope is good though too because you could also use it to, um, fire and then if it's raining or anything, then it can -- 
Speaker 1: Mhm.

03:31.0
Speaker 2: And the -- or the newspaper.
Speaker 2: The rope is good though too because you could also use it to, um, fire and then if it's raining or anything, then it can --

03:48.4 <- interruption concerning content - elicit detail
Speaker 1: Sure.

04:03.6 <- no overlap
Speaker 2: And then compass, six.
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I put the -- this is just like random but like I put the gun as like the last thing probably.
Speaker 2: Mhm.

04:14.8 <- leave out 
Speaker 1: Cause like I feel like everything else is like a bit more useful than like the gun.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Cause like even in terms of likelihood like the least likely thing to happen is that you will die from an animal.
Speaker 1: Like it's more likely that you'll freeze or something like that, so.
Speaker 2: [unclear]

04:21.4 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: [unclear]
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I put that lower than most other stuff.
Speaker 2: I put it at number nine because at that point you just don't know [laughter].
Speaker 1: Okay.

04:29.7 <- no overlap
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah [laughter] fair enough.
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: What number are we on?
Speaker 2: Uh number seven.

04:37.1 <- backchannel
Speaker 1: What number are we on?
Speaker 2: Uh number seven.
Speaker 2: Can of shortening?
Speaker 1: I put that stuff like after all the fire stuff cause like those things are important like getting food but like the most important thing is like staying warm.
Speaker 2: Mhm.

04:54.0 <- backchannel
Speaker 1: I don't think -- does fat burn?
Speaker 1: I don't think it does.
Speaker 1: Or am I?
Speaker 2: I know if you put like bacon grease on a fire, it %.
Speaker 1: Mhm.

05:13.8 <- no overlap
Speaker 2: Okay, so number seven, uh, flashlight?

Speaker 2: Yeah.

05:34.7 <- no overlap
Speaker 2: Um, then what about the extra shirt and pants?
Speaker 1: Um yeah-yeah I think -- cause that is important.
Speaker 2: Mhm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And do we want to do the ball of steel wool cause that's like the fire starter if you have the batteries.

05:38.9 <- interruption concerning action, agreement with a verb
Speaker 1: Um yeah-yeah I think -- cause that is important.

05:53.1 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Compress kit.
Speaker 1: Compression? or yeah.

Speaker 1: Mhm.

06:03.0 <- interruption concerning content, confirm detail
Speaker 1: Does it say that?

Speaker 1: No one is seriously injured.

06:24.5 <- unclear, leave out
Speaker 1: Well if they aren't serious, you don't really --
Speaker 1: Like I feel like everything else is a bit more important than like the gauze like.
Speaker 1: If there's anything even just a bit more useful, like.
Speaker 1: Like for drink -- or for, um, anything besides fire, like the whiskey's, like, I guess for disinfecting it's helpful, but not for like, you don't wanna drink it, cause that'll just make you colder.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

06:53.2 <- backchannel, agreement and no question
Speaker 1: Oh, do we want to do the shortening and the chocolate?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Cause those are food.
Speaker 2: I'll do chocolate first because it's way more important than shortening.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

06:58.8 <- interruption concerning content, confirm detail
Speaker 2: I'll do chocolate first because it's way more important than shortening.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think that's desperation.
Speaker 1: Shortening's kinda like -- like a -- like a some sort of like fat, like a cream thing right?
Speaker 2: It's fat.

07:24.4 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um so.
Speaker 2: Okay so whiskey, ski poles, compress kit, and gun.
Speaker 2: I'm kinda almost thinking the gun next because however long you're out there if you do need to eat then you can at least shoot something right.
Speaker 1: Mhm.

07:47.7 <- no overlap

Speaker 1: Thirteen I think.
Speaker 2: Thank you.

Speaker 1: Thirteen I think.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Maybe the whiskey cause that's like -- you can at least use that to start a fire if you have something else.
