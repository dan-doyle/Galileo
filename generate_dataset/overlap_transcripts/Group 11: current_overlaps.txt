Speaker 2: No - like for me, if you can travel eighty miles in the right direction and like food and everything can be deprived of until the food so.
Speaker 1: Like number one?

02:58.9 <- backchannel (assuming this isnt a clear question)
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 1: Um.
Speaker 2: Because eighty miles in the right direction means you will have, uh, a lot of -- so many chances of surviving.

03:18.0 <- backchannel
Speaker 1: Okay, so two I think like would h-have -- I think would need to be like a food item.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So maybe --
Speaker 2: Family sized chocolate bar because I don't think anybody wants a can of shortening as their first priority to eat.
Speaker 1: Sure.

03:57.6 <- interruption, action (got)
Speaker 1: But yet again it's just because we're thinking differently.
Speaker 1: I was thinking about like more like defence and like survival off of like a very very like long time.
Speaker 2: My approach is that we, uh, go into the ri-right direction.
Speaker 2: So I got flashlight and batteries so if it's dark and --
Speaker 1: Like during -- so you can still move during the night?

04:19.4 <- backchannel
Speaker 2: Yeah so.
Speaker 2: Okay so your approach is that you want to survive and I'll --
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm just like bulk yourself up with like a lot of fat and a lot of like, you know, like have food available.

Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: But, um, okay so for number three, do you think it could be um -- so do you want to have the sectional air map made of plastic?

04:34.4 <- leave out, very unusual as this should be an answer 
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Sure.

05:07.9 <- content
Speaker 1: So I think, uh, for me, I think four should be like this just for heat.
Speaker 1: Like I feel -- because it says that it drops minus forty at night.
Speaker 1: So if you are travelling at night, like even if you have winter gear on.
Speaker 2: Um, it's 11:30 when the plane crashed so it's still like seven to eight hours.
Speaker 1: Yeah but it's --

05:16.8 <- no overlap

Speaker 1: Eighty miles.

05:28.8 <- misplaced speech
Speaker 1: Eighty miles.
Speaker 2: How much time does it take to like walk eighty miles?

Speaker 1: Cause like --

05:47.6 <- no overlap
Speaker 1: Eighty miles in kilometers?
Speaker 1: Kilometers -- like if you're driving in like a car maybe like I think it's like instead of going eighty miles it's like a hundred and twenty.

05:58.0 <- backchannel
Speaker 1: So it's like m-like -- miles are-is much longer than kilometers.
Speaker 2: Yeah yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I think like if it takes like eighty mile -- if you're going eighty miles per hour like in a car, and that's pretty fast, like this is gonna be taking like humans trekking through snow like it's gonna I think take them like maybe a couple of days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

06:15.2 <- action

06:21.4 <- misplaced speech

06:39.9 <- backchannel

Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But what I'm thinking is, um, for example, it's 11:32 and the things that they need most for like the first eight hours and then [unclear].
Speaker 1: So you're thinking more of like it's time oriented rather than --
Speaker 2: Yeah.

07:43.5 <- no overlap
Speaker 2: But to get through this we do need to consider time because it's light in the day when the plane crashed so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying the flashlight doesn't need to be like up on the list it needs to be down because light will --
Speaker 2: Will be there for four to five hours at least.
Speaker 1: Okay okay um.

08:14.8 <- unclear
