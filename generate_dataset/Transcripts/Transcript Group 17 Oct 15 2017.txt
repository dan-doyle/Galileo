17.Orange.1	00:01.7	00:02.4	"Alright."
17.Blue.1	00:03.3	00:09.7	"Okay, so the most important thing, because it's so cold, I put the extra shirt and pants."
17.Orange.2	00:03.4	00:04.1	"Oh."
17.Blue.2	00:09.7	00:11.7	"Because that way everybody could be warm."
17.Orange.3	00:10.0	00:10.4	"Yeah."
17.Yellow.1	00:11.7	00:13.3	"That's what I put too."
17.Blue.3	00:13.6	00:15.0	"So, yeah."
17.Pink.1	00:13.6	00:14.8	"Sounds good."
17.Blue.4	00:15.0	00:25.6	"And then I thought the next one was that the, um, pilot said they were they gave them how far away they were like the direction and whatever."
17.Orange.4	00:23.9	00:24.5	"Okay."
17.Blue.5	00:25.6	00:31.0	"So I put compass and like the map as like two and three."
17.Orange.5	00:31.7	00:32.2	"Okay."
17.Blue.6	00:32.4	00:36.4	"Because that way they know what direction they can go to like."
17.Blue.7	00:36.4	00:41.0	"So they're -- they have like faster way of getting to somewhere with inhabitancy."
17.Orange.6	00:41.3	00:44.2	"Yeah, I had compass as number three."
17.Orange.7	00:45.1	00:56.3	"I think something that will keep them sustainable like the food source or a knife or something would be more important just because they need that while they are travelling to this place."
17.Orange.8	00:56.3	00:58.9	"Cause it will take them a long time to get there right?"
17.Pink.2	00:58.9	00:59.3	"Yeah."
17.Blue.8	00:59.4	00:59.8	"Yeah."
17.Orange.9	00:59.5	01:00.6	"[unclear]"
17.Blue.9	01:01.8	01:07.2	"Okay, so like the chocolate bar goes two and then the compass and map go three."
17.Pink.3	01:02.6	01:04.2	"Chocolate, yeah."
17.Pink.4	01:05.0	01:05.5	"Yeah."
17.Orange.10	01:05.3	01:10.0	"I pu-I think the shortening is more important than the chocolate bar."
17.Orange.11	01:10.2	01:10.6	"Really?"
17.Pink.5	01:12.0	01:13.7	"Sure $."
17.Orange.12	01:12.5	01:19.2	"Well, it's got I know it has like a high fat content, I don't know what it is, but there is a big can of it [unclear]."
17.Orange.13	01:19.3	01:20.8	"I think it will last longer."
17.Pink.6	01:20.9	01:22.1	"So, put that as two then?"
17.Orange.14	01:22.4	01:24.9	"Sure, that's what I put down."
17.Blue.10	01:23.9	01:28.5	"I just like the the only thing is that is says can of shortening so there is only one but then it is family sized chocolate bar one per person."
17.Orange.15	01:27.9	01:28.3	"Yeah."
17.Blue.11	01:28.5	01:31.2	"But then it's family sized chocolate bar, one per person."
17.Orange.16	01:31.8	01:32.3	"True."
17.Orange.17	01:32.7	01:35.2	"I didn't quite go into that detail $."
17.Blue.12	01:35.6	01:46.4	"So, I'm thinking that to get mo-everybody more nutrition, it would be everybody takes a chocolate bar instead of everybody takes like a spoon full of shortening."
17.Orange.18	01:44.8	01:45.3	"Mhm."
17.Orange.19	01:46.1	01:46.6	"Yeah."
17.Orange.20	01:46.7	01:49.5	"And everybody can be kind of responsible for their own ration too $."
17.Blue.13	01:49.3	01:49.8	"Yeah."
17.Pink.7	01:49.4	01:49.8	"$"
17.Orange.21	01:49.5	01:51.5	"That could go good or bad $."
17.Blue.14	01:51.6	01:58.5	"Like you could put like you could put chocolate bar and then shortening so that like they will have the food that way."
17.Orange.22	01:55.3	01:55.7	"Yeah."
17.Pink.8	01:56.1	01:56.5	"Yeah."
17.Orange.23	01:57.7	01:58.1	"Sure."
17.Orange.24	01:58.4	02:00.5	"Either way though, yeah food definitely important."
17.Blue.15	02:00.5	02:04.6	"And then probably the compass is four so they know which direction they're going."
17.Orange.25	02:00.8	02:01.4	"One."
17.Orange.26	02:04.8	02:05.7	"Okay, yeah."
17.Pink.9	02:06.4	02:07.6	"So then the map."
17.Orange.27	02:06.4	02:08.0	"And then we can do --"
17.Blue.16	02:08.0	02:14.0	"And then map because that way they can actually maybe see landmarks or something."
17.Blue.17	02:14.0	02:14.9	"I don't know."
17.Pink.10	02:21.5	02:22.2	"Okay."
17.Blue.18	02:22.5	02:24.1	"And then, I don't know."
17.Blue.19	02:24.1	02:28.6	"I had like flashlight next."
17.Blue.20	02:28.6	02:29.9	"But I don't really."
17.Blue.21	02:31.0	02:33.8	"Like there is -- I mean the whiskey."
17.Blue.22	02:34.8	02:38.6	"It's liquid, but it's not really gonna hydrate them."
17.Orange.28	02:38.7	02:45.6	"No, I was looking at more of a thing to go with compress kit right to, uh, sterilize wounds or something."
17.Orange.29	02:45.8	02:50.8	"It's kind of what I was thinking of the most important so I kind of agree with that."
17.Pink.11	02:45.8	02:46.3	"Yeah."
17.Orange.30	02:50.8	02:55.8	"But of course not as important as stuff from the second half."
17.Orange.31	02:56.0	02:56.8	"And stuff."
17.Blue.23	03:00.5	03:03.7	"So, there the flashlight could help with sight."
17.Blue.24	03:03.7	03:07.0	"And knife and pistol could help with like hunting."
17.Orange.32	03:04.0	03:04.5	"Mhm."
17.Blue.25	03:07.0	03:08.5	"For protection."
17.Orange.33	03:07.2	03:09.2	"Oh, do we not already have knife on the list yet?"
17.Blue.26	03:09.2	03:09.6	"No."
17.Orange.34	03:09.4	03:11.5	"I think we should put that next then $."
17.Pink.12	03:11.3	03:12.4	"Okay, six."
17.Blue.27	03:11.7	03:13.5	"So, like knife is six."
17.Pink.13	03:14.6	03:19.2	"Cause it was like what, eleven thirty-two am, so probably not dark-ish."
17.Blue.28	03:14.6	03:15.4	"And then."
17.Pink.14	03:19.2	03:22.7	"They are in the wood, I guess, so you still have the day, but."
17.Orange.35	03:19.4	03:20.1	"Yeah."
17.Blue.29	03:19.6	03:20.1	"Yeah."
17.Orange.36	03:20.3	03:24.4	"Yeah, so you still have the day, but life is just so versatile right."
17.Blue.30	03:24.6	03:25.1	"Mhm."
17.Orange.37	03:24.6	03:26.2	"Food, making a shelter."
17.Blue.31	03:26.5	03:30.1	"So then should we put the compress kit after the knife?"
17.Pink.15	03:31.1	03:31.5	"Sure."
17.Orange.38	03:31.6	03:32.1	"Yeah."
17.Blue.32	03:40.0	03:40.9	"Um."
17.Blue.33	03:41.9	03:46.1	"Honestly, I don't know what you're going to use the cigarette lighter for with."
17.Blue.34	03:46.1	03:48.7	"And it doesn't have any fluid in it, so it doesn't even light."
17.Orange.39	03:48.1	03:50.0	"You have to get pretty creative, that is for sure."
17.Blue.35	03:50.7	03:53.8	"Um, I don't know what people are going to do with newspaper."
17.Orange.40	03:54.6	03:56.4	"I was thinking insulation."
17.Orange.41	03:56.4	03:59.0	"Almost more better right?"
17.Blue.36	03:58.6	04:01.2	"You could say that, yeah, you could, so."
17.Blue.37	04:01.8	04:09.5	"Is there anything more important than the newspaper like the pistol or a rope like rope or something?"
17.Orange.42	04:07.7	04:08.2	"Mhm."
17.Blue.38	04:11.1	04:17.1	"Like you could almost do like one of those preschool things where everybody holds on to the rope so you don't lose anybody $."
17.Pink.16	04:15.8	04:16.7	"$"
17.Orange.43	04:15.9	04:18.0	"$ okay."
17.Orange.44	04:18.9	04:22.4	"But, yeah again, it gets pretty cold though."
17.Orange.45	04:22.4	04:25.6	"It's like minus something in the night, so."
17.Pink.17	04:24.0	04:24.6	"Yeah."
17.Blue.39	04:25.1	04:29.2	"Yeah, it's like minus twenty-five during the day and then minus fourth at night."
17.Blue.40	04:29.2	04:31.8	"So, probably newspaper would help."
17.Orange.46	04:31.2	04:32.9	"Some pretty extreme cold."
17.Blue.41	04:31.8	04:33.4	"Stuff socks or something."
17.Orange.47	04:34.4	04:34.9	"Yeah."
17.Orange.48	04:35.8	04:38.0	"So, um."
17.Blue.42	04:36.5	04:50.1	"Um, so now we have cigarette lighter, ski poles, whiskey, steel wool, pistol, rope, or batteries or flashlight with batteries."
17.Orange.49	04:40.6	04:41.1	"Cig --"
17.Pink.18	04:52.7	04:55.3	"What does steel wool do for you?"
17.Blue.43	04:55.9	04:56.9	"Um."
17.Orange.50	04:58.4	05:00.2	"Well, I think it's --"
17.Blue.44	04:58.6	05:09.8	"Well, I -- it is wool, but it's like it's like it's like one of those, uh, you know, uh, um, one of those pads that you use for dishwashing like the, um, the pad."
17.Orange.51	05:01.1	05:02.7	"But it's like steel."
17.Pink.19	05:01.4	05:03.1	"But it's like wire isn't it?"
17.Orange.52	05:02.7	05:04.2	"Yeah it's kind of wiry, it's -- "
17.Pink.20	05:05.9	05:07.5	"[unclear]"
17.Pink.21	05:07.5	05:08.1	"Oh okay."
17.Orange.53	05:08.1	05:08.5	"Yeah."
17.Blue.45	05:10.4	05:12.6	"Like yeah yeah."
17.Pink.22	05:11.3	05:12.7	"Yeah I do know $."
17.Orange.54	05:11.4	05:11.8	"Yeah."
17.Orange.55	05:12.3	05:13.5	"Pretty sure, yeah."
17.Orange.56	05:13.5	05:19.6	"So, it's, uh, probably just going to be just a little bit stronger than rope maybe."
17.Blue.46	05:19.2	05:19.8	"Yeah."
17.Orange.57	05:19.6	05:21.8	"I wonder you might be able to use that to start a fire."
17.Orange.58	05:21.8	05:24.4	"I feel like that seems like something [unclear] $."
17.Orange.59	05:24.4	05:26.6	"It might be far-fetched, but."
17.Pink.23	05:25.0	05:26.2	"$"
17.Pink.24	05:27.6	05:29.3	"We can just pretend it will start a fire $."
17.Blue.47	05:29.4	05:30.9	"I mean like we if you have --"
17.Orange.60	05:29.6	05:31.9	"Like I'm wondering if [unclear]."
17.Pink.25	05:32.2	05:34.5	"Yeah, cause newspaper probably won't do it."
17.Blue.48	05:36.2	05:36.9	"Um."
17.Orange.61	05:36.4	05:41.8	"I'm wondering cigarette lighter too if you could even like spark it off the rock, like the top of it, like what's it made up."
17.Blue.49	05:40.0	05:41.5	"Wait a second."
17.Pink.26	05:41.8	05:42.4	"Yeah."
17.Orange.62	05:42.4	05:44.0	"So I don't know if that's gonna work."
17.Blue.50	05:42.5	05:46.5	"If you have -- could you use the whiskey as a lighter fluid?"
17.Orange.63	05:47.9	05:49.3	"It's possible."
17.Orange.64	05:49.4	05:51.8	"Can't verify but I'm sure it's possible."
17.Pink.27	05:49.6	05:50.6	"[Unclear]."
17.Blue.51	05:51.5	05:53.4	"Cause I mean."
17.Pink.28	05:53.4	05:54.5	"Let's just go with yes."
17.Blue.52	05:54.5	05:54.9	"Yeah."
17.Orange.65	05:56.5	05:57.9	"Alright with that being said."
17.Blue.53	05:57.0	05:59.5	"Cause alcohol is flammable."
17.Pink.29	05:58.1	06:00.1	"Will that be higher up on list then?"
17.Orange.66	06:00.1	06:00.7	"Oh yeah."
17.Pink.30	06:00.2	06:01.0	"$"
17.Blue.54	06:01.2	06:11.5	"Cause you can if combine the alcohol like if you put the whiskey and then the cigarette lighter and you could use the whiskey as a lighter fluid."
17.Pink.31	06:01.6	06:03.1	"I don't even know what that is."
17.Blue.55	06:11.5	06:13.3	"Because alcohol is flammable."
17.Orange.67	06:13.3	06:13.8	"Mhm."
17.Orange.68	06:14.2	06:14.9	"Cause."
17.Blue.56	06:14.6	06:17.1	"Cause with the lighter, it'll spark it, and you can."
17.Orange.69	06:16.6	06:17.2	"Yeah."
17.Pink.32	06:17.2	06:17.6	"Yeah."
17.Blue.57	06:17.4	06:22.2	"So, that's if that's for warmth that could definitely go before."
17.Pink.33	06:22.2	06:23.0	"Newspaper?"
17.Blue.58	06:23.0	06:23.5	"Yeah."
17.Orange.70	06:23.6	06:26.3	"Cause we can go technically days without food."
17.Orange.71	06:26.3	06:31.5	"With even water, you're going to need to boil it to make sure that it's, you know."
17.Pink.34	06:26.6	06:27.0	"But you can --"
17.Blue.59	06:30.7	06:37.6	"But like, uh, cause I think we should put it as like six and seven near the compress kit and newspaper down to nine, ten. "
17.Pink.35	06:37.6	06:38.9	"Okay, so whiskey first?"
17.Orange.72	06:37.8	06:38.3	"Yeah."
17.Blue.60	06:38.9	06:39.3	"Yeah."
17.Blue.61	06:39.3	06:40.8	"Whiskey is six."
17.Pink.36	06:40.9	06:41.4	"And then."
17.Blue.62	06:41.2	06:42.9	"Cigarette lighter is seven."
17.Blue.63	06:43.6	06:44.6	"And then."
17.Pink.37	06:43.8	06:45.6	"And the compress kit is eight."
17.Blue.64	06:44.9	06:45.7	"Eight."
17.Blue.65	06:45.7	06:47.8	"And then newspaper's nine."
17.Orange.73	06:50.0	06:55.7	"I just feel like it could be more important than the extra shirt and pants for each survivor cause as long as we can make fire."
17.Pink.38	07:01.7	07:03.7	"Like the the fo-fire stuff?"
17.Orange.74	07:03.9	07:04.6	"Yeah."
17.Orange.75	07:08.8	07:10.2	"What is everybody thinking?"
17.Blue.66	07:10.2	07:14.0	"I also I mean it is important."
17.Blue.67	07:14.0	07:35.3	"But I feel like getting initial warmth is like the like getting initial warmth through the pants and shirts and then trying to figure out where you're going and getting prepared before starting a fire or anything cause it is during the day so they are going to want to move first like get moving and then when it gets dark they get like they get like they have the ability to make fire."
17.Orange.76	07:28.1	07:28.6	"Yeah."
17.Pink.39	07:30.7	07:32.3	"That makes sense."
17.Blue.68	07:35.3	07:39.1	"So, I think having it later on in the list is."
17.Pink.40	07:35.6	07:36.0	"Yeah."
17.Blue.69	07:40.5	07:41.0	"Cool."
17.Orange.77	07:41.3	07:44.1	"So, where are we left now with the?"
17.Blue.70	07:44.2	07:46.5	"We're left with ski poles."
17.Orange.78	07:45.2	07:46.2	"Are we at ten?"
17.Pink.41	07:46.9	07:51.1	"Steel wool, pistol, rope, and flashlight."
17.Blue.71	07:51.5	07:52.4	"Um."
17.Orange.79	07:51.6	07:52.6	"I think rope."
17.Pink.42	07:56.3	07:57.5	"Or flashlight."
17.Blue.72	07:56.4	07:57.4	"Uh."
17.Blue.73	07:58.1	07:59.2	"It's betw --"
17.Orange.80	07:59.3	08:01.3	"$"
17.Blue.74	07:59.5	08:06.5	"Honestly, the pistol the pistol can help with hunting or like just protection in general."
17.Pink.43	08:00.5	08:01.5	"That's good."
17.Orange.81	08:06.7	08:07.2	"Yeah."
17.Blue.75	08:07.4	08:11.2	"And then the flashlight would help with when it gets dark out."
17.Blue.76	08:11.2	08:14.9	"I don't really know what thirty feet of rope would do for you."
17.Orange.82	08:15.2	08:16.4	"Make shelter."
17.Blue.77	08:17.6	08:22.0	"You could tie things together, but that's more like when they actually have to camp up."
17.Blue.78	08:22.1	08:24.8	"So, I feel like if pistol came first."
17.Pink.44	08:22.4	08:23.1	"Mhm."
17.Orange.83	08:25.4	08:28.7	"But just kind of what are the chances that you are going to use it?"
17.Blue.79	08:29.0	08:29.6	"True."
17.Orange.84	08:30.4	08:34.0	"So, just kind of -- it-it's a gamble right."
17.Orange.85	08:34.0	08:34.9	"What do you think?"
17.Blue.80	08:35.2	08:36.0	"Mhm."
17.Orange.86	08:36.0	08:37.6	"Is it going to be more necessary?"
17.Blue.81	08:39.2	08:41.1	"And you are in Manitoba."
17.Orange.87	08:41.2	08:42.1	"Yeah $."
17.Blue.82	08:44.6	08:45.6	"Um, so."
