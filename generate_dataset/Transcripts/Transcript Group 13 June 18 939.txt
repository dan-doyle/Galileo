13.Yellow.2	00:04.9	00:06.9	"And then we'll see, what's just -- what's just similar."
13.Yellow.3	00:06.9	00:09.5	"And then we'll work on narrowing it down."
13.Blue.1	00:08.1	00:08.8	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.4	00:09.6	00:12.0	"So, a compression kit -- what did you give it?"

13.Blue.15	00:32.0	00:32.5	"Eight."
13.Yellow.19	00:32.7	00:33.2	"Eight."
13.Blue.16	00:33.2	00:33.6	"Two."
13.Yellow.20	00:34.0	00:34.5	"Two."
13.Blue.17	00:34.6	00:35.0	"Three."
13.Yellow.21	00:35.0	00:35.5	"Three."
13.Yellow.22	00:36.0	00:38.6	"Okay, so, I did eight."
13.Yellow.23	00:38.9	00:39.5	"Three."
13.Yellow.24	00:40.7	00:41.4	"Four."

13.Yellow.26	00:43.6	00:44.1	"Ten."
13.Yellow.27	00:45.9	00:47.0	"Twelve."
13.Yellow.28	00:47.3	00:47.9	"Two."
13.Yellow.29	00:48.1	00:50.4	"Well, we have some differences."
13.Yellow.30	00:51.1	00:53.2	"And some-some are very similar."
13.Yellow.31	00:53.2	00:53.8	"Seven."
13.Yellow.32	00:55.0	00:55.7	"Nine."
13.Yellow.33	00:56.7	00:58.2	"Six, very nice."
13.Yellow.34	00:59.1	01:00.0	"Fifteen."
13.Yellow.35	01:00.1	01:00.8	"Five."
13.Yellow.36	01:01.0	01:01.8	"And one."
13.Yellow.37	01:02.1	01:02.7	"Okay."
13.Yellow.38	01:02.9	01:05.1	"So, we have similar in the compression kit."
13.Yellow.39	01:05.2	01:06.7	"You have a ten, I have an eight."
13.Yellow.40	01:08.1	01:10.4	"Umm, you want to split it into a nine?"
13.Blue.18	01:09.0	01:12.0	"But there's a big difference in the second and third."
13.Yellow.41	01:11.5	01:12.0	"Yeah."
13.Blue.19	01:12.1	01:13.9	"Because $ I don't smoke, so."
13.Yellow.42	01:13.9	01:15.6	"Yeah, and I don't smoke either."
13.Yellow.43	01:15.6	01:20.5	"The reason why I suggest the cigarette lighter, is because it'll have a spark."
13.Blue.20	01:18.2	01:18.6	"Okay."
13.Yellow.44	01:20.8	01:23.9	"And the spark matched with the eighty-five proof whiskey."
13.Blue.21	01:22.1	01:26.5	"But, uh, we can do the like... uh, flashlight with batteries."
13.Yellow.45	01:26.7	01:28.6	"A -- to make a spark?"
13.Yellow.46	01:28.6	01:31.8	"You could if you were Bear Grylls who knows how to do that stuff."
13.Yellow.47	01:31.8	01:34.0	"But I'm not, I'm pretty un-unsavvy."
13.Yellow.48	01:34.1	01:37.4	"So, spark and eighty-five proof whiskey will start a fire."
13.Blue.22	01:37.4	01:37.8	"Oh."
13.Yellow.49	01:37.5	01:38.1	"#"
13.Yellow.50	01:38.2	01:39.6	"And then it's like gasoline."
13.Yellow.51	01:40.3	01:44.3	"And uh... then the newspaper rolled up, will be the kindling."
13.Yellow.52	01:44.4	01:47.3	"Because I imagine and it's wet and it's in Manitoba and it's damp."
13.Yellow.53	01:47.3	01:54.8	"But it's -- and it's cold and stuff and a lot of the stuff will be -- you'll need some strong fire before it can start making some of the wood even start a fire."
13.Blue.23	01:54.5	01:55.1	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.54	01:55.0	01:57.3	"So, that was my thinking behind that."
13.Yellow.55	01:57.4	02:04.0	"And a fire in minus twenty-five and minus forty degree weather I think would be very very crucial to staying warm."
13.Yellow.56	02:04.3	02:06.7	"I did watch Alive and they didn't have much of a fire."
13.Yellow.57	02:06.7	02:09.9	"But I-I would prefer one just because."
13.Yellow.58	02:10.9	02:11.6	"Um."
13.Blue.24	02:10.9	02:11.4	"Yeah."
13.Blue.25	02:11.4	02:12.0	"I agree."
13.Yellow.59	02:12.3	02:13.3	"But how about this?"
13.Yellow.60	02:13.7	02:16.4	"How about we split the ten and the eight, make it a nine?"
13.Yellow.61	02:16.5	02:17.5	"That seems relatively --"
13.Yellow.62	02:17.5	02:19.3	"So, for compression kit, let's do nine."
13.Blue.26	02:17.7	02:18.2	"Yeah."
13.Blue.27	02:19.4	02:19.9	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.63	02:19.9	02:22.3	"Anything that's relatively common, we split."
13.Yellow.64	02:22.3	02:22.7	"How about that?"
13.Yellow.65	02:22.7	02:23.9	"And that just gets us down."
13.Yellow.66	02:23.9	02:26.0	"So, we have six and seven loaded pistol."
13.Yellow.67	02:26.4	02:28.2	"Um, let's go six for you."
13.Yellow.68	02:28.2	02:29.8	"We'll-we'll, no you take a six."
13.Blue.28	02:28.5	02:29.5	"Yeah, sure."
13.Yellow.69	02:30.4	02:32.1	"We don't have much time right, all set."
13.Blue.29	02:31.8	02:32.3	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.70	02:32.1	02:33.6	"And then the knife would be the seventh."
13.Yellow.71	02:33.8	02:35.9	"So, uh, we don't need to argue on those ones."
13.Blue.30	02:34.8	02:35.4	"Okay."
13.Yellow.72	02:36.8	02:37.4	"Um."
13.Yellow.73	02:37.9	02:41.3	"I could just stay here for hours and argue about stuff, but I won't."
13.Blue.31	02:40.7	02:41.5	"$"
13.Yellow.74	02:41.6	02:44.0	"Um, extra shirt and pants."
13.Yellow.75	02:44.5	02:45.9	"I put that as number one."
13.Blue.32	02:45.1	02:46.0	"I gave three."
13.Yellow.76	02:45.9	02:47.0	"You gave it a three."
13.Yellow.77	02:47.9	02:58.1	"And you know what, with my whole fire being so important to me that I think I could s-I s-could surmise that the shirt and stuff could dry with a fire."
13.Blue.33	02:51.5	02:51.9	"Yeah."
13.Blue.34	02:58.3	02:58.9	"Um."
13.Yellow.78	02:58.6	03:00.1	"So, I-I'll go with yours."
13.Yellow.79	03:00.3	03:01.5	"We'll go with the three."
13.Blue.35	03:00.6	03:01.1	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.80	03:02.2	03:03.8	"Or, or we'll go with the two."
13.Yellow.81	03:03.8	03:04.8	" How about split?"
13.Yellow.82	03:04.8	03:05.7	"Let's do two."
13.Blue.36	03:05.0	03:05.9	"Yeah, two."
13.Yellow.83	03:06.5	03:07.8	"I didn't even realize that."
13.Yellow.84	03:08.1	03:08.8	"Okay."
13.Yellow.85	03:09.7	03:10.8	"I have five."
13.Yellow.86	03:10.9	03:12.4	"You have flashlight, too."
13.Blue.37	03:12.9	03:20.0	"Okay, so maybe we can do five and then we can do -- give priority to the cigarette lighter and --"
13.Yellow.87	03:13.6	03:14.1	"Um."
13.Yellow.88	03:16.9	03:17.5	"Okay."
13.Yellow.89	03:19.9	03:21.0	"Yeah, okay."
13.Blue.38	03:20.4	03:21.0	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.90	03:21.3	03:23.1	"Okay, so we'll do that."
13.Yellow.91	03:23.6	03:24.3	"Um."
13.Yellow.92	03:26.1	03:27.6	"So, we have here."
13.Yellow.93	03:27.6	03:30.5	"Okay, so cigarette lighter, we'll do three."
13.Blue.39	03:30.9	03:31.3	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.94	03:31.5	03:32.0	"Okay."
13.Yellow.95	03:33.7	03:35.6	"Newspaper, h-hi."
13.Yellow.96	03:35.6	03:37.9	"Let's go somewhere else's first before we get to that."
13.Yellow.97	03:37.9	03:40.2	"Let's see if there's anything else we're closest."
13.Blue.40	03:40.0	03:41.4	"Uh, chocolate bar."
13.Yellow.98	03:41.2	03:44.4	"Chocolate bars, y-you know what, obviously we're going to need to eat."
13.Blue.41	03:44.7	03:45.3	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.99	03:45.0	03:45.6	"Right."
13.Yellow.100	03:45.6	03:46.2	"Um."
13.Yellow.101	03:46.8	03:47.6	"Uh."
13.Yellow.102	03:48.0	03:49.8	"Uh, where are we here?"
13.Yellow.103	03:49.8	03:51.4	"What did I put for the chocolate bar?"
13.Blue.42	03:50.2	03:51.5	"Uh, I gave --"
13.Yellow.104	03:51.9	03:52.7	"A nine."
13.Blue.43	03:52.8	03:53.2	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.105	03:55.0	03:55.8	"Let's eat."
13.Yellow.106	03:55.8	03:56.5	"Let's do nine."
13.Blue.44	03:56.5	03:57.0	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.107	03:57.3	03:57.9	"Okay."
13.Yellow.108	03:58.7	03:59.5	"Um."
13.Yellow.109	04:02.1	04:03.0	"It's eighty miles."
13.Blue.45	04:03.4	04:04.5	"[unclear]"
13.Yellow.110	04:03.4	04:05.6	"We have, we have a full belly of chocolate."
13.Yellow.111	04:05.6	04:06.3	"We're warm."
13.Yellow.112	04:06.3	04:07.8	"We got fire we're bringing."
13.Yellow.113	04:08.0	04:13.8	"Possibly if then hunting with the knife and a loaded gu -- pistol might possibly have helped."
13.Blue.46	04:14.1	04:14.7	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.114	04:14.8	04:19.8	"Um... at one point, if-if they don't see the fire, we may have to figure out."
13.Yellow.115	04:19.8	04:21.0	"Oh, um."
13.Blue.47	04:21.2	04:24.7	"And map, air map made of plastic."
13.Yellow.116	04:23.9	04:25.4	"So, the m-air map will help."
13.Blue.48	04:25.6	04:26.1	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.117	04:25.8	04:26.4	"Um."
13.Blue.49	04:26.8	04:28.7	"I gave one $."
13.Yellow.118	04:28.9	04:30.1	"Let's go f --"
13.Blue.50	04:30.5	04:33.1	"Uh, and we're between somewhere."
13.Yellow.119	04:32.9	04:35.1	"I would... h-hi."
13.Blue.51	04:34.5	04:35.1	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.120	04:36.2	04:37.4	"I think first thing's first."
13.Yellow.121	04:37.5	04:38.6	"We need to warm up."
13.Yellow.122	04:38.6	04:40.2	"We need to settle."
13.Yellow.123	04:40.2	04:41.3	"You make a plan."
13.Yellow.124	04:41.3	04:43.6	"You get, you get yourself warmed up."
13.Yellow.125	04:43.6	04:45.7	"You get damaged up in case there's any --"
13.Yellow.126	04:45.7	04:47.6	"Although it says there's very little damage."
13.Yellow.127	04:48.2	04:52.2	"You get warmed up, you get settled, you maybe you know get-get prepared."
13.Yellow.128	04:52.2	04:53.7	"So I think that that stuff's first."
13.Blue.52	04:52.3	04:52.8	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.129	04:53.7	04:57.1	"So I would put the newspaper at high as, uh, as the four."
13.Yellow.130	04:57.1	04:59.9	"I'll keep the newspaper as a four cause it's kindling to start."
13.Blue.53	04:58.8	04:59.3	"Kindling."
13.Yellow.131	04:59.9	05:02.6	"And everybody can get it and get a fire going that you can maintain."
13.Yellow.132	05:02.7	05:03.5	"That's just me."
13.Yellow.133	05:04.2	05:05.0	"So, we'll do that."
13.Yellow.134	05:06.1	05:11.0	"Now, the quart of whiskey is pretty important too cause it's kindling."
13.Yellow.135	05:11.7	05:14.4	"Uh, oh, let's do, let's do newspaper five."
13.Blue.54	05:12.8	05:13.3	"So."
13.Yellow.136	05:14.4	05:15.0	"How about that?"
13.Yellow.137	05:15.0	05:15.6	"Is that cool?"
13.Blue.55	05:15.2	05:19.3	"Uh, we gave already five to the flashlight."
13.Yellow.138	05:17.9	05:19.0	"Oh, okay."
13.Yellow.139	05:21.0	05:23.4	"Do we need the quart of whiskey to start the fire too?"
13.Yellow.140	05:23.5	05:24.0	"Hm."
13.Blue.56	05:24.2	05:25.1	"Uh."
13.Yellow.141	05:25.3	05:26.2	"Do we have a three?"
13.Yellow.142	05:26.2	05:26.7	"Okay."
13.Yellow.143	05:26.7	05:27.3	"Number two."
13.Blue.57	05:27.3	05:29.2	"We didn't give one to anything."
13.Yellow.144	05:29.0	05:30.2	"We didn't give one to anything?"
13.Yellow.145	05:30.2	05:30.8	"Oh."
13.Yellow.146	05:34.7	05:36.2	"What would you like to do the one?"
13.Yellow.147	05:37.8	05:38.2	"Let's --"
13.Blue.58	05:38.4	05:42.1	"They work together, so we can give five to this one."
13.Yellow.148	05:43.6	05:45.4	"Let's give, uh, five to this one."
13.Blue.59	05:44.7	05:45.5	"Sorry, one."
13.Yellow.149	05:45.7	05:46.5	"One to the --"
13.Blue.60	05:46.4	05:46.9	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.150	05:47.0	05:47.7	"This one?"
13.Yellow.151	05:47.7	05:48.7	"What you want me to do?"
13.Yellow.152	05:50.0	05:50.7	"Okay."
13.Blue.61	05:50.3	05:50.8	"Uh."
13.Yellow.153	05:51.2	05:51.6	"Um."
13.Blue.62	05:52.3	05:55.5	"Maybe we can do the... one here."
13.Yellow.154	05:54.0	05:54.5	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.155	05:54.5	05:56.0	"Let's, let's do one here."
13.Blue.63	05:55.8	05:56.3	"Yeah."
13.Blue.64	05:56.5	05:57.0	"Uh."
13.Yellow.156	05:57.3	05:58.1	"Let's do that."
13.Yellow.157	05:58.2	05:59.3	"And then three here."
13.Blue.65	05:59.1	05:59.7	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.158	06:00.1	06:00.6	"Okay."
13.Yellow.159	06:00.7	06:01.8	"And then, um."
13.Yellow.160	06:03.0	06:03.7	"Um."
13.Yellow.161	06:04.4	06:05.6	"So we got ourselves --"
13.Yellow.162	06:05.6	06:07.0	"I don't know what shortening is."
13.Yellow.163	06:07.0	06:09.7	"Is it like... food?"
13.Blue.66	06:09.7	06:11.4	"Yeah, I think so."
13.Yellow.164	06:10.0	06:11.9	"Food, food's important."
13.Yellow.165	06:12.5	06:14.5	"Let's put that at the ten again."
13.Yellow.166	06:14.5	06:15.6	"Let's just do ten."
13.Blue.67	06:15.6	06:17.4	"It's I think kind of powder."
13.Yellow.167	06:17.6	06:22.1	"Yeah, it'll make some food with the heat of the fire, uh, probably helps, so."
13.Yellow.168	06:22.1	06:25.1	"And then chocolate, you might make a smores, who knows $."
13.Yellow.169	06:25.1	06:26.2	"Not really $."
13.Blue.68	06:25.6	06:26.2	"$"
13.Yellow.170	06:26.2	06:27.4	"[unclear]"
13.Yellow.171	06:27.7	06:28.4	"We'll do ten."
13.Blue.69	06:28.4	06:28.9	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.172	06:29.0	06:29.5	"Um."
13.Yellow.173	06:29.5	06:33.1	"Okay, so, uh, how about the --"
13.Blue.70	06:31.9	06:32.7	"[unclear]"
13.Blue.71	06:33.3	06:34.5	"Two ski poles."
13.Yellow.174	06:34.3	06:35.8	"We'll keep that nine."
13.Yellow.175	06:35.8	06:36.7	"So that's compress kit."
13.Yellow.176	06:36.7	06:38.1	"You know, no one's hurt."
13.Yellow.177	06:38.3	06:40.4	"Um, so, now compass and a map."
13.Yellow.178	06:40.4	06:41.7	"Those are coming up there."
13.Yellow.179	06:41.7	06:46.9	"So, let's -- we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
13.Yellow.180	06:47.4	06:49.5	"Let's do comp -- let's do map eight."
13.Blue.72	06:49.9	06:50.4	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.181	06:51.9	06:52.8	"And then --"
13.Yellow.182	06:52.8	06:53.9	"Oh, we have two nines."
13.Yellow.183	06:53.9	06:54.6	"Dammit."
13.Yellow.184	06:55.6	06:57.2	"Umm, compression kit will change."
13.Yellow.185	06:57.3	06:59.3	"We'll do that a little bit later cause there's no one injured."
13.Yellow.186	06:59.3	07:00.6	"The chocolate bar's pretty important."
13.Blue.73	07:00.3	07:01.0	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.187	07:01.6	07:03.1	"So, we'll do that as a ten."
13.Yellow.188	07:03.1	07:04.1	"Compression kit is ten."
13.Yellow.189	07:04.8	07:07.4	"Um... compass is important."
13.Blue.74	07:08.2	07:08.7	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.190	07:08.3	07:10.9	"Cause if -- you need to know where you're at."
13.Yellow.191	07:10.9	07:13.8	"Probably even more important cause if you go North."
13.Blue.75	07:12.3	07:12.9	"Right."
13.Blue.76	07:13.1	07:15.6	"Give four to [unclear]."
13.Yellow.192	07:14.9	07:16.1	"I know, um."
13.Yellow.193	07:19.4	07:22.8	"Uh, eleven, now is what we got next."
13.Yellow.194	07:23.0	07:23.5	"In order."
13.Blue.77	07:23.4	07:23.9	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.195	07:23.5	07:24.7	"We have tens too."
13.Yellow.196	07:24.8	07:25.4	"Dammit."
13.Blue.78	07:25.3	07:28.8	"We can give eleven to this one, maybe ten to that?"
13.Yellow.197	07:28.5	07:29.5	"Eleven to this."
13.Yellow.198	07:29.6	07:30.6	"We have a ten down here."
13.Yellow.199	07:30.6	07:31.4	"Can of shortening."
13.Yellow.200	07:31.5	07:32.6	"Twelve to the compass."
13.Blue.79	07:33.1	07:33.8	"Maybe."
13.Yellow.201	07:38.9	07:40.0	"Twelve to compass."
13.Blue.80	07:39.5	07:40.1	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.202	07:44.3	07:45.2	"Mhm."
13.Blue.81	07:45.3	07:47.0	"Uh, steel wool."
13.Yellow.203	07:45.9	07:46.5	"Compass."
13.Yellow.204	07:47.1	07:47.6	"Okay."
13.Yellow.205	07:47.8	07:48.4	"And uh."
13.Yellow.206	07:49.3	07:49.9	"Uh."
13.Blue.82	07:50.2	07:52.0	"Thirteen already and the fourteen."
13.Yellow.207	07:52.1	07:53.6	"What is the ball of steel going to do?"
13.Yellow.208	07:53.8	07:54.6	"Steel wool."
13.Blue.83	07:54.0	07:54.7	"Steel wool."
13.Yellow.209	07:55.1	07:56.0	"What will it do?"
13.Blue.84	07:56.2	08:02.2	"Steel wool is like uh, like uh, like uh --  steel heat, uh [unclear]."
13.Yellow.210	07:57.4	07:58.0	"I know."
13.Yellow.211	08:00.3	08:02.4	"Yeah because create a spark."
13.Yellow.212	08:02.5	08:04.0	"We have a lighter, that's kind of -- "
13.Yellow.213	08:04.2	08:05.9	"Depending on survivor's, but."
13.Blue.85	08:05.6	08:06.1	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.214	08:07.5	08:11.4	"Rope may help traverse if we plan to be coming out a little more."
13.Blue.86	08:09.8	08:10.2	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.215	08:11.4	08:15.7	"So, I... I would do steel wool as fourteen."
13.Blue.87	08:13.3	08:14.3	"[unclear]"
13.Yellow.216	08:15.7	08:18.3	"Ski poles, or, third -- or last."
13.Yellow.217	08:18.3	08:21.1	"Ski poles, you might want to build a hi-hike."
13.Yellow.218	08:21.1	08:22.4	"I'll do that as last."
13.Yellow.219	08:22.5	08:25.3	"So, I would... I would do this fourteen."
13.Blue.88	08:25.3	08:25.9	"Uh."
13.Yellow.220	08:26.7	08:27.7	"This, thirteen."
13.Yellow.221	08:28.6	08:29.9	"That, fifteen."
13.Blue.89	08:30.0	08:30.4	"Okay."
13.Yellow.222	08:30.4	08:31.1	"Does that work?"
13.Blue.90	08:31.1	08:31.5	"Yeah."
13.Yellow.223	08:32.0	08:32.6	"We're done."
13.Yellow.224	08:34.0	08:37.4	"Probably not as great as we both would hope."
13.Blue.91	08:35.8	08:36.5	"$"
13.Yellow.225	08:37.5	08:39.7	"But we compromised."
