8.Orange.24	01:19.5	01:20.3	"But I think --"
8.Green.17	01:20.9	01:24.0	"But at this exact moment in time, I do not feel like we need it."
8.Orange.25	01:22.1	01:29.5	"Yeah, I would probably go with the compress kit over the flashlight just cause injury is more important than seeing in the dark probably."
8.Green.18	01:27.8	01:29.6	"Okay, so, let's go with -- okay, so let's --"

8.Orange.35	01:55.7	01:57.4	"So, which did you guys have for five?"
8.Green.27	01:57.3	02:04.4	"I had newspaper but only cause I was going with the having the whi-whiskey so then I would make a fire cause you know it's cold out."
8.Orange.36	02:00.2	02:01.9	"The -- for making a fire?"

8.Orange.39	02:09.5	02:10.0	"True."

8.Blue.29	02:12.6	02:13.1	"Hm."
8.Green.30	02:13.7	02:22.1	"So, then I was like well you have the whiskey and then you have the newspaper then you should be able to if you like hit something together you would be able to make a fire."
8.Green.31	02:22.1	02:23.5	"But that was just my thought."

8.Orange.41	02:26.6	02:29.7	"Then we'd have to have the whiskey as number six then."

8.Blue.36	03:17.5	03:17.9	"Oh."

8.Orange.103	05:20.6	05:22.2	"I had the cigarette lighter $."
8.Green.74	05:21.8	05:23.6	"Oh, look at us all doing that. "
8.Orange.104	05:23.5	05:24.0	"Um $."
8.Blue.58	05:23.8	05:24.4	"I would."
8.Green.75	05:24.3	05:29.4	"So, the only one we haven't used that -- oh no, we haven't used air map or... the chocolate bar one."
8.Blue.59	05:29.7	05:33.7	"I think I would rather go with map than the chocolate bar in those scenarios, unless like right now."
8.Green.76	05:33.7	05:35.0	"But I mean, what if we're hungry?"
8.Blue.60	05:33.8	05:34.4	"I don't know."
8.Blue.61	05:36.1	05:36.9	"Eat the map."
8.Green.77	05:36.5	05:38.2	"$ eat the map."
8.Orange.105	05:37.0	05:44.3	"Or we could go, we could go further in the correct direction in order to get food more quickly if we had a map and I think."
8.Green.78	05:43.6	05:45.7	"Okay, so do the map next then?"
8.Orange.106	05:45.2	05:45.5	"Yeah."
8.Orange.107	05:45.5	05:47.8	"Plus one family sized chocolate bar doesn't last."
8.Green.79	05:47.8	05:49.8	"Okay, so the air map is nine."
8.Orange.108	05:48.6	05:49.1	"You know."
8.Orange.109	05:49.9	05:50.4	"Yeah."
8.Green.80	05:51.6	05:53.4	"Okay, what was your guys' ten?"
8.Blue.62	05:53.7	05:54.2	"Uh."
8.Orange.110	05:53.9	05:55.4	"Don't forget we have to come back to five."
8.Green.81	05:55.1	05:56.3	"Yes, we'll come back to five."
8.Orange.111	05:55.5	05:59.5	"$ just cause if we're left with like the least important one then we have to put that."
8.Green.82	05:58.8	06:00.4	"That would be very unfortunate $."
8.Orange.112	06:00.1	06:01.4	"Yeah $."
8.Blue.63	06:01.2	06:05.3	"I put can of shortening but I can't remember why."
8.Green.83	06:03.2	06:03.7	"Uh."
8.Orange.113	06:03.9	06:04.9	"I don't really know."
8.Orange.114	06:04.9	06:05.7	"Yeah $."
8.Orange.115	06:05.7	06:06.7	"It felt like a good idea."
8.Green.84	06:06.4	06:08.7	"I had rope but that was just for that."
8.Blue.64	06:08.2	06:11.3	"Oh right, uh, it has a lot of energy cause of a lot of fat."
8.Orange.116	06:11.5	06:14.0	"Oh, so if we needed to, we could eat."
8.Blue.65	06:11.9	06:12.4	"Yeah."
8.Blue.66	06:12.6	06:14.3	"A lot more than chocolate bar, so."
8.Green.85	06:13.7	06:15.1	"You can also use it to burn."
8.Blue.67	06:15.0	06:15.4	"Yeah."
8.Green.86	06:15.5	06:16.2	"Fat burns."
8.Blue.68	06:16.2	06:16.7	"Mhm."
8.Orange.117	06:16.7	06:18.0	"Okay, I like shortening."
8.Orange.118	06:18.3	06:20.8	"That was my fifteen, but I feel like that makes more sense."
8.Green.87	06:18.3	06:18.7	"Okay."
8.Green.88	06:19.2	06:19.8	"That's for."
8.Green.89	06:20.8	06:22.4	"That was my fifteen too $."
8.Blue.69	06:20.9	06:21.4	"Hm."
8.Orange.119	06:22.1	06:23.2	"Yeah $."
8.Green.90	06:22.4	06:24.7	"Um, for te-so-ten is shortening?"
8.Orange.120	06:24.6	06:25.1	"Yeah."
8.Green.91	06:25.2	06:25.6	"Okay."
8.Green.92	06:26.9	06:27.3	"Alright."
8.Green.93	06:28.1	06:29.6	"Eleven, I had the flashlight."
8.Green.94	06:29.9	06:30.6	"As eleven."
8.Orange.121	06:30.6	06:31.7	"I had the newspaper."
8.Blue.70	06:31.8	06:33.0	"I had the whiskey."
8.Orange.122	06:33.8	06:38.9	"I thought, I think, for um... newspaper, I didn't think it was as important."
8.Orange.123	06:38.9	06:44.9	"Just cause if we have like trees and branches like there's kindling and stuff that can, if we're in the middle of the forest."
8.Green.95	06:44.3	06:46.5	"Could I just go back to five for one second?"
8.Orange.124	06:46.3	06:47.1	"Yeah, for sure."
8.Blue.71	06:46.4	06:47.6	"Sure, probably a good call."
8.Green.96	06:46.9	06:50.9	"We cigar -- we have the cigarette lighter without the fluid but it has the flint in it."
8.Blue.72	06:50.9	06:51.3	"Mhm."
8.Green.97	06:50.9	06:56.5	"The easiest, the easiest way to do something that is either the whiskey or the newspaper because it'll catch fire."
8.Orange.125	06:51.4	06:53.0	"Do you want to -- whiskey?"
8.Green.98	06:56.5	07:01.1	"But I mean I think probably the whiskey would be easier because it has a higher chance of catching fire."
8.Orange.126	06:59.6	07:00.0	"Sure."
8.Green.99	07:01.2	07:02.0	"That's just my thought."
8.Orange.127	07:01.3	07:03.6	"Yeah, let's go with whiskey if you're okay with that."
8.Green.100	07:02.5	07:03.2	"For five?"
8.Blue.73	07:03.5	07:04.7	"As five, sure. "
8.Green.101	07:03.6	07:04.5	"Are you okay with that?"
8.Blue.74	07:04.7	07:06.9	"As always, that alcohol is very important."
8.Orange.128	07:06.5	07:07.5	"$"
8.Green.102	07:06.8	07:07.5	"$"
8.Orange.129	07:08.4	07:11.1	"Um, okay, and we were at eleven then?"
8.Green.103	07:08.5	07:09.8	"Well, it catches fire, so."
8.Blue.75	07:09.5	07:10.1	"Hm."
8.Green.104	07:11.3	07:12.0	"Yes."
8.Orange.130	07:12.3	07:12.7	"Okay."
8.Orange.131	07:12.9	07:17.0	"We have the chocolate bar, newspaper, ski poles, flashlight."
8.Green.105	07:13.2	07:14.3	"I had the flashlight."
8.Orange.132	07:17.0	07:19.8	"I think flashlight would be a good time to put that one."
8.Green.106	07:19.1	07:21.3	"I think this would be a good time to have the flashlight $."
8.Green.107	07:22.1	07:22.5	"Yeah?"
8.Orange.133	07:22.2	07:22.8	"Yeah."
8.Blue.76	07:22.5	07:23.2	"Let's go for it."
8.Green.108	07:23.2	07:23.8	"Okay."
8.Orange.134	07:23.4	07:23.8	"Yeah."
8.Orange.135	07:23.8	07:24.9	"And then, twelve."
8.Orange.136	07:25.5	07:29.0	"Does anyone know what the function of a steel wool could be used for?"
8.Green.109	07:29.0	07:31.4	"It can be for cleaning stuff, or."
8.Orange.137	07:31.5	07:32.1	"$"
8.Green.110	07:31.8	07:35.1	"$ I don't know I'd have to -- if we can find something to clean."
8.Orange.138	07:33.7	07:35.8	"I'm sure there's some use for it, um."
8.Green.111	07:35.1	07:36.7	"Sure, we can something for it."
8.Green.112	07:36.7	07:37.4	"Um."
8.Blue.77	07:36.7	07:42.4	"Um, I thought it burns really bright so you can use it to signal but I don't know how well that would work if there's like trees."
8.Orange.139	07:39.0	07:39.5	"Yeah."
8.Green.113	07:40.6	07:42.5	"I had the ski poles as twelve."
8.Green.114	07:42.5	07:46.3	"Because you know if you're like hiking through the woods and you need to like pull yourself."
8.Orange.140	07:46.1	07:48.4	"But there's only two and there's three of us."
8.Green.115	07:46.5	07:51.2	"But that was just -- I know that's just awkward moment $."
8.Orange.141	07:48.4	07:49.5	"Awkward."
8.Orange.142	07:50.2	07:50.8	"$"
8.Blue.78	07:51.4	07:51.9	"Oh."
8.Orange.143	07:51.5	07:52.0	"Um."
8.Orange.144	07:53.2	07:55.5	"I think, yeah, honestly these ones and --"
8.Orange.145	07:56.4	07:58.2	"The newspaper could be used to start a fire."
8.Orange.146	07:58.2	07:59.5	"The poles could be used for the hiking."
8.Orange.147	07:59.5	08:01.2	"Chocolate bar we can eat."
8.Orange.148	08:01.2	08:06.1	"But the steel wool, I feel like that might be a fifteen probably."
8.Green.116	08:06.2	08:07.4	"Yeah, I'm thinking, yeah."
8.Green.117	08:07.4	08:12.7	"I'm not sure if I can find a really good reason to use steel wool at this exact moment especially."
8.Orange.149	08:12.0	08:13.8	"You want to put that one as a fifteen then?"
8.Green.118	08:13.8	08:14.4	"Yeah."
8.Orange.150	08:14.1	08:14.5	"Okay."
8.Green.119	08:15.0	08:16.9	"Okay, so fifteen is steel wool."
8.Orange.151	08:16.4	08:16.8	"Yeah."
8.Green.120	08:17.7	08:18.2	"Okay."
8.Green.121	08:18.5	08:20.7	"So, we still have newspaper."
8.Orange.152	08:21.0	08:22.4	"We're at twelve, thirteen."
8.Orange.153	08:23.3	08:23.9	"Um."
8.Green.122	08:23.7	08:26.3	"Two ski poles, the family sized chocolate bar."
8.Blue.79	08:26.9	08:29.9	"I'd rather have a chocolate bar than newspaper or ski poles."
8.Orange.154	08:29.0	08:29.7	"I would too."
8.Orange.155	08:29.7	08:31.7	"I'd probably put the chocolate bar as twelve."
8.Green.123	08:29.9	08:30.5	"Okay."
8.Green.124	08:30.9	08:32.1	"So, twelve."
8.Blue.80	08:31.2	08:31.6	"Yeah."
8.Orange.156	08:32.2	08:32.6	"Yeah."
8.Orange.157	08:33.3	08:36.0	"And then honestly, the newspaper probably could be last."
8.Orange.158	08:36.0	08:37.2	"For me anyways."
8.Orange.159	08:37.2	08:37.9	"Just cause."
8.Green.125	08:37.5	08:40.2	"We have a steel-steel-steel wool and stuff, so."
8.Blue.81	08:39.5	08:40.2	"Well, what if --"
8.Orange.160	08:39.5	08:41.1	"Well, like fourteen, yeah."
8.Green.126	08:40.2	08:41.1	"Like fourteen?"
8.Blue.82	08:41.5	08:44.1	"What is the use of wet newspaper again?"
8.Orange.161	08:43.9	08:44.3	"Yeah."
8.Orange.162	08:44.5	08:46.6	"Plus if it rains then we're all screwed."
8.Green.127	08:46.1	08:47.7	"Again I was going for fire."
8.Blue.83	08:46.3	08:46.8	"Yeah."
8.Green.128	08:47.7	08:49.2	"But that was before that, so."
8.Blue.84	08:48.0	08:48.4	"Hm."
8.Orange.163	08:48.9	08:49.6	"Um."
8.Green.129	08:49.9	08:50.6	"Um."
8.Orange.164	08:50.2	08:53.7	"We can do thirteen as the ski poles and then fourteen as newspaper, yeah."
8.Green.130	08:51.4	08:52.7	"Thirteen as the ski poles?"
8.Green.131	08:53.7	08:54.1	"Okay."
8.Blue.85	08:53.7	08:54.3	"Alright."
8.Green.132	08:54.8	08:55.3	"Alright."
8.Blue.86	08:55.3	08:56.2	"Sounds good."
8.Orange.165	08:55.9	08:56.5	"Cool."
8.Green.133	08:56.1	08:56.8	"Sounds good to me."
