19.Blue.1	00:00.4	00:06.8	"Okay, um, so what I wrote my first priority was flashlights with batteries."
19.Blue.2	00:06.8	00:13.2	"Because once you crash land and it's night, since they it landed like in the morning, but still when it's dark."
19.Blue.3	00:13.5	00:17.2	"Uh, because it's like a jungle and there's no habitation."
19.Blue.4	00:17.2	00:20.8	"So I think flashlight would be the most important to see around."
19.Blue.5	00:21.3	00:22.5	"What do you guys think?"
19.Pink.1	00:23.1	00:24.6	"I put -- oh sorry, go ahead."
19.Orange.1	00:23.1	00:23.6	"I put --"
19.Orange.2	00:24.7	00:28.0	"Um, I put flashlight as like my fourth because it's important."
19.Orange.3	00:28.0	00:37.2	"But I also thought that -- I thought that the compress kiss-kit was the most important just because like in case if there's any injuries, we want to work on keeping everyone's safe."
19.Orange.4	00:37.2	00:44.6	"But I do agree that the flashlight is important because they can also use batteries that eventually can make a fire and see everything with it too."
19.Blue.6	00:41.7	00:42.4	"Yeah."
19.Blue.7	00:43.2	00:43.7	"Yeah."
19.Pink.2	00:45.0	00:54.5	"Yeah, I did the shirt and pants cause it's in Manitoba and it says it gets down to like negative forty so I was like you probably want to stay as warm as possible."
19.Orange.5	00:50.4	00:51.0	"Yeah."
19.Pink.3	00:54.7	00:55.7	"Um."
19.Orange.6	00:54.7	00:55.3	"Yeah."
19.Orange.7	00:57.7	01:13.2	"Well, and -- cause they crash at 11:32 in the morning, so it's not gonna get dark for a while too, so I figured -- I figured if they got probably the pants or probably be the best idea to first getting everyone warm."
19.Pink.4	01:01.3	01:01.8	"Yeah."
19.Pink.5	01:04.1	01:04.6	"Yeah."
19.Blue.8	01:05.0	01:06.4	"Okay, yeah."
19.Blue.9	01:12.0	01:12.8	"Yeah let's do --"
19.Pink.6	01:12.0	01:13.0	"What do we want?"
19.Pink.7	01:13.1	01:14.8	"Shirt and pants first?"
19.Orange.8	01:13.2	01:16.6	"Yeah, probably the [unclear] everyone can stay warm and safe."
19.Pink.8	01:16.8	01:17.3	"Okay."
19.Pink.9	01:18.4	01:20.5	"And what did we want to do next?"
19.Pink.10	01:20.5	01:23.0	"The flashlight we were going to do next?"
19.Blue.10	01:23.0	01:25.1	"Um, I did the compass next."
19.Orange.9	01:25.3	01:26.2	"Yeah because then --"
19.Blue.11	01:25.9	01:30.1	"Just to um -- yeah, getting direction of, uh, where they want to go."
19.Pink.11	01:27.0	01:27.6	"Compass."
19.Orange.10	01:30.1	01:31.6	"Yeah, cause it says like --"
19.Pink.12	01:31.1	01:35.3	"But do we want the map before we have the compass though so that we --"
19.Orange.11	01:35.5	01:36.1	"Maybe."
19.Pink.13	01:36.8	01:39.2	"Or do we want the compass before the map?"
19.Orange.12	01:39.5	01:43.5	"Probably the compass first because they know the direction that they have to go."
19.Blue.12	01:43.3	01:44.1	"Yeah."
19.Orange.13	01:43.5	01:45.5	"So we're seeing [unclear] and we can go."
19.Pink.14	01:43.8	01:44.4	"Okay."
19.Blue.13	01:44.4	01:51.6	"Uh, because they were like, um, that you were eighty miles northwest of a small town."
19.Orange.14	01:51.5	01:52.1	"Hm."
19.Blue.14	01:51.6	02:02.7	"So we figure out which, um, if they have -- if they figure out what they have for compass that they need to go to northwest and then probably we'll do that with a map, then-then it does make sense, so."
19.Pink.15	01:52.0	01:52.5	"Oh yeah."
19.Pink.16	02:00.1	02:00.6	"Okay."
19.Pink.17	02:02.1	02:05.1	"Okay, so shirt and pants and then compass."
19.Blue.15	02:05.4	02:06.9	"And then we can do the map."
19.Pink.18	02:07.3	02:09.3	"And map, okay."
19.Pink.19	02:11.1	02:14.5	"And we -- would we want to do the gun next?"
19.Pink.20	02:14.5	02:16.7	"So that we can like kill stuff to eat."
19.Blue.16	02:14.7	02:16.0	"Yeah, yeah."

19.Blue.22	02:27.0	02:27.5	"Um."
19.Pink.24	02:28.0	02:32.3	"And then do we want flashlight probably so that we can see when it's dark out?"

19.Orange.19	02:43.8	02:50.6	"Well, if they already have like a caliber to get food, they should probably like start with fire and shelter stuff, right?"
