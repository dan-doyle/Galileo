3.Green.1	00:00.2	00:03.5	"I said that the most important thing was the cigarette lighter."
3.Green.2	00:03.5	00:06.3	"Because the most important thing probably is to stay warm."
3.Pink.1	00:06.5	00:07.6	"It has no fluid."
3.Green.3	00:07.6	00:11.7	"Yeah, well, you can use it still with the flint to start a fire."
3.Green.4	00:12.3	00:15.4	"So, if you can get wood together then."
3.Pink.2	00:13.2	00:13.7	"Okay."
3.Green.5	00:15.5	00:16.3	"What about you?"
3.Pink.3	00:16.5	00:19.2	"I did, uh, flashlight and batteries."
3.Green.6	00:19.2	00:19.9	"Okay."
3.Pink.4	00:19.9	00:21.8	"Because I'm a chicken, so."
3.Green.7	00:20.9	00:21.4	"Mhm."
3.Green.8	00:21.5	00:22.2	"Yeah."
3.Pink.5	00:22.2	00:22.8	"Yeah."
3.Green.9	00:23.5	00:24.1	"Okay."
3.Green.10	00:24.1	00:26.1	"I put that one as number five."
3.Green.11	00:26.9	00:36.4	"Mainly cause like if you have a fire going like I'm not sure if it would be -- I guess it would be better to move at night cause you'd stay warmer then cause that's when it's colder."
3.Pink.6	00:30.5	00:31.3	"Yep."
3.Pink.7	00:34.9	00:35.5	"Mhm."
3.Pink.8	00:36.0	00:36.8	"Mhm."
3.Green.12	00:36.7	00:43.1	"But if you have a fire going then you could probably just sleep at night and you wouldn't need the flashlight, but."
3.Pink.9	00:42.4	00:43.0	"Mhm."
3.Pink.10	00:43.5	00:47.9	"I obviously don't know much about lighters because I wasn't even thinking about the flint."
3.Green.13	00:47.7	00:48.2	"$"
3.Pink.11	00:47.9	00:50.8	"So that was my fourteenth choice $."
3.Green.14	00:49.7	00:50.3	"Mhm."
3.Pink.12	00:50.9	00:53.4	"But I agree with you with the cigarette lighter."
3.Pink.13	00:53.4	00:55.5	"If you can use that for fire then yeah."
3.Green.15	00:54.5	00:55.0	"Mhm."
3.Pink.14	00:55.5	00:58.9	"Kinda changes everything that I put actually."
3.Green.16	00:57.5	00:58.2	"Mhm."
3.Pink.15	00:59.0	01:03.1	"So, um, so you want us to mark on here, okay?"
3.Pink.16	01:03.7	01:05.2	"So."
3.Pink.17	01:06.1	01:08.9	"Okay, so, then your second choice?"
3.Green.17	01:09.0	01:11.1	"Um, I said the knife."
3.Pink.18	01:12.0	01:17.2	"I did extra shirts and pants just so it was another layer on your body."
3.Green.18	01:13.8	01:14.7	"Okay."
3.Green.19	01:15.5	01:17.3	"Mhm yeah."
3.Pink.19	01:18.0	01:18.8	"Um."
3.Green.20	01:20.8	01:22.0	"Okay."
3.Pink.20	01:23.4	01:23.9	"Hm."
3.Green.21	01:24.0	01:30.3	"For me like my reasoning was like I kinda listed everything in order of stuff you could possibly build a fire with."
3.Pink.21	01:29.8	01:30.4	"Mhm."
3.Green.22	01:30.3	01:32.7	"And then after that I moved onto stuff like that."
3.Green.23	01:32.7	01:34.5	"So that one's lower on my list."
3.Pink.22	01:34.4	01:35.1	"Mhm."
3.Green.24	01:34.5	01:39.7	"Like it's still important cause like you wanna change your layers so you aren't cold if you get sweaty."
3.Pink.23	01:38.4	01:40.3	"No totally agree."
3.Pink.24	01:40.3	01:47.3	"Just because with mine, I had it backwards because I was -- no I didn't have a fire at that point $ so."
3.Green.25	01:42.4	01:43.1	"Mhm."
3.Green.26	01:46.4	01:47.2	"Yeah."
3.Pink.25	01:47.7	01:48.6	"Yeah."
3.Pink.26	01:49.1	01:51.4	"Okay so."
3.Green.27	01:53.6	01:56.7	"What do you think, do you think that's?"
3.Pink.27	01:54.6	02:01.7	"No cause the knife is, well, even if there's animals or whatever, it's-it's some sort of protection right."
3.Green.28	01:59.5	02:00.2	"Mhm."
3.Green.29	02:00.9	02:01.6	"Mhm."
3.Pink.28	02:02.9	02:15.5	"Um, okay, third I put compass, but it would probably be better to have like either newspaper or rope or something because it's a dual purpose if you can light it and you can --"
3.Green.30	02:12.5	02:13.3	"Mhm."
3.Green.31	02:15.5	02:19.1	"Yeah, well, I -- for me, for number three, I put the map."
3.Pink.29	02:19.0	02:19.8	"Mhm."
3.Green.32	02:19.5	02:22.9	"So -- cause -- and then after that I put the compass."
3.Pink.30	02:22.1	02:22.6	"Mhm."
3.Green.33	02:23.0	02:29.0	"Cause then those like -- cause like the compass -- I guess it's kind of useful but it's more useful if you have the map first."
3.Pink.31	02:28.8	02:29.3	"Mhm."
3.Green.34	02:29.5	02:30.2	"So."
3.Green.35	02:31.2	02:36.2	"But, yeah, now I'm thinking like maybe I should list like everything that you could use to make a first first."
3.Pink.32	02:36.0	02:36.6	"Mhm."
3.Green.36	02:37.3	02:42.2	"Cause like the whiskey you could use to start a fire with if you have a lighter or something."
3.Pink.33	02:42.0	02:42.8	"Mhm."
3.Green.37	02:42.9	02:46.2	"And the flashlight and the steel wool you could start a fire with."
3.Green.38	02:46.2	02:50.1	"Cause like if you put batteries on steel wool it like creates a fire."
3.Pink.34	02:50.1	02:54.5	"I'm gonna die if I ever crash $."
3.Green.39	02:51.6	02:53.7	"$"
3.Pink.35	02:54.5	02:56.0	"I'm taking you with me."
3.Pink.36	02:56.2	02:59.0	"Okay, so what do you want to put for number three?"
3.Green.40	02:59.0	03:00.2	"Um, I don't know."
3.Green.41	03:00.3	03:00.9	"What do you think?"
3.Green.42	03:00.9	03:02.3	"The map maybe?"
3.Pink.37	03:02.8	03:04.7	"Do you want to do map or fire?"
3.Green.43	03:06.2	03:10.3	"Hm, sure we can do the fire first."
3.Pink.38	03:10.6	03:12.0	"Okay, so which one?"
3.Pink.39	03:12.0	03:17.5	"Wool, rope, um, or alcohol?"
3.Green.44	03:19.1	03:22.1	"Um, well, the newspaper also, we can use that one, too."
3.Pink.40	03:20.9	03:22.5	"And the -- or the newspaper."
3.Pink.41	03:22.5	03:31.0	"The rope is good though too because you could also use it to, um, fire and then if it's raining or anything, then it can -- "
3.Green.45	03:24.2	03:24.9	"Mhm."
3.Green.46	03:29.2	03:33.1	"Yeah like it's pretty functional to make shelter or something."
3.Pink.42	03:31.0	03:31.7	"Mhm."
3.Pink.43	03:32.6	03:33.4	"Yep."
3.Green.47	03:33.1	03:33.5	"Mhm."
3.Pink.44	03:33.6	03:34.3	"Okay."
3.Pink.45	03:35.6	03:39.0	"And then number four?"
3.Pink.46	03:39.9	03:43.6	"Um so should -- maybe newspaper."
3.Green.48	03:43.0	03:43.7	"Sure."
3.Pink.47	03:43.6	03:44.5	"Okay."
3.Pink.48	03:44.8	03:47.8	"And then go for the map after that?"
3.Green.49	03:47.9	03:49.1	"That sounds good to me."
3.Pink.49	03:48.4	03:49.7	"You think, yeah?"
3.Green.50	03:49.5	03:50.1	"Yeah."
3.Pink.50	03:50.2	03:52.4	"Uh, where is it?"
3.Green.51	03:52.0	03:53.3	"Map is -- yeah."
3.Pink.51	03:52.9	03:53.7	"Okay."
3.Pink.52	03:53.7	03:55.5	"And then compass, six."
3.Green.52	03:55.6	03:56.4	"Mhm."
3.Pink.53	03:56.7	03:58.0	"Okay."
3.Green.53	03:59.3	04:04.1	"I put the -- this is just like random but like I put the gun as like the last thing probably."
3.Pink.54	04:03.6	04:04.3	"Mhm."
3.Green.54	04:04.3	04:07.9	"Cause like I feel like everything else is like a bit more useful than like the gun."
3.Pink.55	04:07.6	04:08.4	"Yep."
3.Green.55	04:08.4	04:14.2	"Cause like even in terms of likelihood like the least likely thing to happen is that you will die from an animal."
3.Green.56	04:14.2	04:17.4	"Like it's more likely that you'll freeze or something like that, so."
3.Pink.56	04:14.8	04:16.3	"[unclear]"
3.Pink.57	04:16.3	04:16.8	"Yeah."
3.Green.57	04:18.1	04:20.1	"I put that lower than most other stuff."
3.Pink.58	04:20.1	04:25.1	"I put it at number nine because at that point you just don't know $."
3.Green.58	04:21.4	04:22.2	"Okay."
3.Green.59	04:23.2	04:25.7	"Yeah $ fair enough."
3.Pink.59	04:26.1	04:27.5	"Um."
3.Green.60	04:28.2	04:29.9	"What number are we on?"
3.Pink.60	04:29.7	04:31.0	"Uh number seven."
3.Pink.61	04:32.1	04:33.7	"Can of shortening?"
3.Green.61	04:34.8	04:42.0	"I put that stuff like after all the fire stuff cause like those things are important like getting food but like the most important thing is like staying warm."
3.Pink.62	04:37.1	04:38.0	"Mhm."
3.Pink.63	04:41.0	04:41.9	"Can you use it to burn?"
3.Pink.64	04:41.9	04:43.5	"Is it another thing you can burn?"
3.Green.62	04:43.6	04:44.8	"I don't know."
3.Green.63	04:46.8	04:48.3	"I don't think -- does fat burn?"
3.Green.64	04:48.3	04:49.9	"I don't think it does."
3.Green.65	04:50.2	04:51.1	"Or am I?"
3.Pink.65	04:51.5	04:54.4	"I know if you put like bacon grease on a fire, it %."
3.Green.66	04:54.0	04:54.7	"Mhm."
3.Pink.66	04:55.3	04:57.6	"So, I don't know if it would have the same kind of concept."
3.Pink.67	04:58.4	04:59.2	"I don't know."
3.Pink.68	04:59.3	05:02.6	"Okay, um."
3.Pink.69	05:04.2	05:09.4	"Okay, so number seven, uh, flashlight?"
3.Pink.70	05:09.4	05:10.5	"See in the dark?"
3.Pink.71	05:11.0	05:12.9	"I don't know if you try to make your way."
3.Green.67	05:12.9	05:14.0	"Flashlight?"
3.Pink.72	05:13.8	05:14.5	"Mhm."
3.Green.68	05:14.3	05:15.0	"Um."
3.Pink.73	05:14.6	05:18.0	"Cause then we'd need the batteries, too."
3.Green.69	05:18.2	05:19.0	"Yeah."
3.Green.70	05:19.2	05:22.1	"Did we -- yeah we already did newspaper, never mind, yeah."
3.Pink.74	05:20.7	05:21.5	"Yeah."
3.Pink.75	05:22.4	05:26.2	"Um, then what about the extra shirt and pants?"
3.Green.71	05:27.2	05:31.5	"Um yeah-yeah I think -- cause that is important."
3.Pink.76	05:31.2	05:31.9	"Mhm."
3.Pink.77	05:34.1	05:35.2	"Okay."
3.Green.72	05:34.7	05:40.4	"And do we want to do the ball of steel wool cause that's like the fire starter if you have the batteries."
3.Pink.78	05:38.9	05:39.6	"Okay."
3.Pink.79	05:40.6	05:41.4	"Yeah."
3.Pink.80	05:44.8	05:46.0	"Compress kit."
3.Green.73	05:46.2	05:48.3	"Compression? or yeah."
3.Pink.81	05:50.4	05:54.7	"You don't know if -- y-you're surviving in minimal injuries but it still --"
3.Green.74	05:53.1	05:53.7	"Mhm."
3.Green.75	05:53.8	05:55.3	"Does it say that?"
3.Pink.82	05:55.9	06:01.3	"It said that, um, there was --"
3.Green.76	06:01.3	06:01.6	"Hm."
3.Green.77	06:01.6	06:04.0	"Yeah it doesn't specify if there's --"
3.Pink.83	06:03.0	06:05.6	"It doesn't specify, but most likely."
3.Green.78	06:04.2	06:05.9	"No one is seriously injured."
3.Pink.84	06:06.1	06:09.3	"But you're still gonna have probably open wounds and whatever right."
3.Green.79	06:10.3	06:12.4	"Well if they aren't serious, you don't really --"
3.Green.80	06:12.4	06:16.3	"Like I feel like everything else is a bit more important than like the gauze like."
3.Green.81	06:16.3	06:20.0	"If there's anything even just a bit more useful, like."
3.Green.82	06:21.8	06:35.6	"Like for drink -- or for, um, anything besides fire, like the whiskey's, like, I guess for disinfecting it's helpful, but not for like, you don't wanna drink it, cause that'll just make you colder."
3.Pink.85	06:24.5	06:24.7	"Yeah."
3.Pink.86	06:30.8	06:31.5	"Mhm."
3.Pink.87	06:35.4	06:35.9	"Mhm."
3.Green.83	06:36.9	06:38.0	"Um."
3.Green.84	06:41.9	06:43.3	"So what should we?"
3.Green.85	06:43.4	06:46.2	"Oh, do we want to do the shortening and the chocolate?"
3.Pink.88	06:46.6	06:47.1	"Okay."
3.Green.86	06:47.1	06:48.5	"Cause those are food."
3.Pink.89	06:51.9	06:54.7	"I'll do chocolate first because it's way more important than shortening."
3.Green.87	06:53.2	06:53.9	"Yeah."
3.Pink.90	06:54.7	06:56.0	"I think that's desperation."
3.Green.88	06:56.0	07:00.7	"Shortening's kinda like -- like a -- like a some sort of like fat, like a cream thing right?"
3.Pink.91	06:58.8	07:00.0	"It's fat."
3.Pink.92	07:00.4	07:01.8	"Yeah it's thick."
3.Green.89	07:00.7	07:01.2	"Okay."
3.Pink.93	07:01.8	07:03.0	"Disgusting."
3.Pink.94	07:03.6	07:04.8	"Okay."
3.Pink.95	07:06.1	07:08.0	"Um so."
3.Pink.96	07:09.3	07:14.2	"Okay so whiskey, ski poles, compress kit, and gun."
3.Pink.97	07:19.0	07:26.8	"I'm kinda almost thinking the gun next because however long you're out there if you do need to eat then you can at least shoot something right."
3.Green.90	07:24.4	07:25.1	"Mhm."
3.Green.91	07:26.8	07:27.4	"Yeah."
3.Pink.98	07:27.5	07:29.2	"So twelve."
3.Pink.99	07:31.2	07:33.9	"Maybe the ski poles because you can roast on it?"
3.Green.92	07:34.6	07:37.7	"Yeah or even if it just saves a bit of energy like."
3.Green.93	07:37.9	07:40.2	"Any energy saved is good, so."
3.Pink.100	07:40.2	07:40.7	"Mhm."
3.Green.94	07:40.7	07:42.5	"If it makes your like hiking easier."
3.Pink.101	07:42.7	07:43.4	"Yeah."
3.Pink.102	07:45.1	07:46.3	"Uh."
3.Green.95	07:46.6	07:48.5	"Thirteen I think."
3.Pink.103	07:47.7	07:48.5	"Thank you."
3.Green.96	07:49.1	07:56.2	"Maybe the whiskey cause that's like -- you can at least use that to start a fire if you have something else."
3.Pink.104	07:55.9	07:56.4	"Yep."
3.Green.97	07:56.3	07:58.0	"Like it'll make it a lot easier."
3.Pink.105	07:57.7	07:58.3	"Mhm."
3.Pink.106	08:00.0	08:00.9	"Okay."
3.Green.98	08:01.0	08:01.7	"Sure."
