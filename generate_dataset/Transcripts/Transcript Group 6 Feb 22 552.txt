6.Blue.2	00:03.4	00:05.1	"Okay, so, what do you guys have?"
6.Pink.1	00:05.2	00:12.7	"Uh, I was thinking of going one by one, or like the things that we have reasons why they're in that place."
6.Green.1	00:12.6	00:14.6	"Yeah, I think we shift from one and go from there."
6.Green.2	00:14.6	00:16.7	"So, like what does everyone have for number one?"
6.Blue.3	00:16.9	00:17.3	"Okay."
6.Pink.2	00:17.1	00:17.5	"Um."
6.Orange.1	00:17.5	00:18.6	"Flashlight."
6.Pink.3	00:18.6	00:19.1	"Okay."
6.Pink.4	00:19.4	00:21.8	"I have, uh, the extra shirt and pants."
6.Blue.4	00:21.8	00:22.6	"Yeah, me too."
6.Green.3	00:22.9	00:24.3	"And I have a compass."
6.Pink.5	00:24.6	00:25.0	"Yeah."
6.Pink.6	00:25.4	00:26.0	"Uh."
6.Green.4	00:25.7	00:28.3	"So, should we do like majority or?"
6.Pink.7	00:28.4	00:30.6	"Well, we can just say, we can say the reasons."
6.Green.5	00:28.7	00:30.7	"What-what we think too?"
6.Blue.5	00:30.6	00:31.2	"Yeah."
6.Pink.8	00:30.6	00:31.4	"Yeah."
6.Green.6	00:30.9	00:31.3	"Okay."
6.Pink.9	00:31.4	00:40.1	"Because I was thinking that since it's minus twenty-five and we are like city winter equipped, we're not really equipped for minus twenty-five."
6.Pink.10	00:40.1	00:42.5	"And what in Manitoba."
6.Green.7	00:41.8	00:43.1	"Minus forty at night. "
6.Pink.11	00:43.0	00:45.0	"Minus forty at night, that's even worse."
6.Blue.6	00:43.6	00:47.6	"Yeah, but it's, um, 11:32 am, so it's pretty early."
6.Pink.12	00:47.7	00:48.2	"Mhm."
6.Green.8	00:47.9	00:48.5	"Yeah."
6.Blue.7	00:48.2	00:52.4	"And it's out in the woods, so it's still pretty cold anyway."
6.Pink.13	00:52.3	00:53.0	"Yeah."
6.Blue.8	00:53.0	00:58.7	"So, the main thing would be staying warm and then figuring out food."
6.Pink.14	00:55.5	00:56.2	"Staying warm."
6.Pink.15	00:56.5	00:57.0	"Yeah."
6.Pink.16	00:57.8	01:00.8	"My top five are usually we need to stay warm."
6.Orange.2	00:59.6	01:00.3	"$"
6.Pink.17	01:00.8	01:02.1	"That's the first thing we need to do."
6.Blue.9	01:01.6	01:02.2	"Yeah."
6.Pink.18	01:02.1	01:06.5	"Because, uh, over night, everybody can die just out of -- "
6.Blue.10	01:06.5	01:07.0	"Yeah."
6.Green.9	01:06.8	01:07.4	"Mhm."
6.Blue.11	01:07.0	01:14.7	"And like, you can survive a lot less in cold than with food or yeah."
6.Pink.19	01:12.1	01:13.7	"Than from anything else."
6.Green.10	01:13.6	01:14.9	"What did you put again?"
6.Orange.3	01:14.9	01:16.0	"I put flashlight."
6.Green.11	01:15.9	01:17.1	"Flashlight to see?"
6.Pink.20	01:16.9	01:17.4	"Yeah."
6.Orange.4	01:16.9	01:17.4	"Yeah."
6.Pink.21	01:17.8	01:20.0	"Like I said, it's fairly early in the morning."
6.Orange.5	01:19.3	01:20.4	"In the day, yeah."
6.Pink.22	01:20.1	01:23.5	"And if we have fire, then we don't really need a flashlight."
6.Blue.12	01:23.1	01:23.7	"Yeah."
6.Green.12	01:24.2	01:33.4	"I did compass because I personally, like I get the warm thing a hundred percent, but from where I'm coming from, it mentioned that there was like a town."
6.Pink.23	01:29.1	01:30.0	"Hm."
6.Green.13	01:33.4	01:38.1	"And my first surviving mode would be like I need to find shelter, I need to find somewhere."
6.Pink.24	01:36.6	01:37.9	"Mhm."
6.Green.14	01:38.8	01:40.9	"So I think the compass is very important."
6.Green.15	01:40.9	01:44.5	"But, with your guys' point, I think the two of you did that and I totally agree."
6.Green.16	01:44.5	01:46.3	"I think that, that should be number one."
6.Pink.25	01:44.8	01:45.7	"Mhm."
6.Blue.13	01:46.3	01:46.9	"Yeah."
6.Orange.6	01:46.4	01:46.9	"Yeah."
6.Green.17	01:46.5	01:47.6	"So everyone agree?"
6.Orange.7	01:47.5	01:47.9	"Yeah."
6.Blue.14	01:47.5	01:47.9	"Yeah."
6.Green.18	01:47.9	01:48.3	"Okay."
6.Green.19	01:48.4	01:51.9	"That was the warmth one, extra shirt and pants."
6.Green.20	01:52.9	01:53.7	"Okay."
6.Green.21	01:54.0	01:56.1	"Uh, what everyone have for two?"
6.Pink.26	01:56.9	01:58.7	"Uh, I had the ball of steel wool."
6.Orange.8	01:58.7	01:59.5	"So did I."
6.Green.22	01:59.5	01:59.9	"Kay."
6.Blue.15	01:59.9	02:03.9	"I put the newspaper just to like build on the fire stuff."
6.Pink.27	02:02.0	02:02.5	"Hm."
6.Pink.28	02:03.1	02:03.6	"Yeah."
6.Orange.9	02:03.8	02:04.3	"Yeah."
6.Pink.29	02:03.8	02:08.3	"I-I feel that my two, three and four are interchangeable."
6.Green.23	02:07.3	02:10.0	"Yeah-uh-there's a couple ones that where it's like it could be --"
6.Orange.10	02:08.9	02:09.5	"Yeah."
6.Pink.30	02:09.5	02:09.9	"Yeah."
6.Blue.16	02:09.9	02:10.3	"Yeah."
6.Pink.31	02:10.1	02:10.8	"What is it?"
6.Green.24	02:10.2	02:14.8	"Cause I -- for that one, I put a compress kit cause the plane crashed, so."
6.Pink.32	02:14.5	02:15.0	"Mhm."
6.Green.25	02:14.8	02:18.5	"I feel like that could instantly save people."
6.Blue.17	02:16.2	02:19.0	"Yeah, but there's no serious injuries."
6.Pink.33	02:18.2	02:18.8	"Yeah."
6.Green.26	02:19.0	02:19.5	"Pardon?"
6.Pink.34	02:19.3	02:22.4	"No one is seriously injured."
6.Blue.18	02:19.4	02:21.4	"There's no serious injury."
6.Green.27	02:21.7	02:22.2	"Yeah."
6.Pink.35	02:22.4	02:26.5	"And I'm pretty sure the cold helps with wounds."
6.Blue.19	02:25.6	02:26.7	"I don't know, cause like --"
6.Pink.36	02:26.5	02:27.2	"I don't know."
6.Blue.20	02:26.7	02:28.6	"The first aid kit is important."
6.Pink.37	02:28.6	02:29.1	"Yeah."
6.Green.28	02:29.1	02:29.7	"Yeah."
6.Blue.21	02:29.1	02:33.1	"But in any case like something attacks or whatever."
6.Pink.38	02:33.1	02:33.8	"Mhm."
6.Blue.22	02:33.5	02:36.6	"It's not gonna be very helpful though."
6.Green.29	02:34.1	02:36.2	"That's where my mind was kind of going too."
6.Green.30	02:36.7	02:39.3	"Like something could happen because --"
6.Green.31	02:39.3	02:40.2	"Mhm."
6.Blue.23	02:39.6	02:42.0	"Yeah, but the gauzes and all of that."
6.Blue.24	02:42.0	02:45.9	"It's better to use, I don't know, the extra shirt or something like that."
6.Pink.39	02:42.1	02:42.7	"Mhm."
6.Pink.40	02:46.2	02:46.9	"Yeah."
6.Blue.25	02:46.4	02:52.1	"And then tie it on with something other than the gauzes and the band aids."
6.Green.32	02:47.6	02:48.2	"Yeah."
6.Green.33	02:48.5	02:49.1	"Okay."
6.Pink.41	02:48.7	02:49.6	"Mhm."
6.Blue.26	02:52.1	02:56.7	"Because like the first aid kits that I have seen are usually pretty simple."
6.Blue.27	02:56.8	02:59.2	"And like --"
6.Green.34	02:58.4	03:03.1	"Yeah, I guess it depends to what extend that that one would have too."
6.Blue.28	03:01.1	03:01.5	"Yeah."
6.Pink.42	03:01.5	03:02.1	"Yeah."
6.Green.35	03:03.2	03:05.2	"Um, what did you guys put again, sorry?"
6.Pink.43	03:04.9	03:06.6	"Uh, ball of steel wool."
6.Orange.11	03:06.1	03:06.8	"Same."
6.Green.36	03:06.5	03:08.6	"Should we do something with warmth then?"
6.Green.37	03:08.6	03:09.6	"That would work too?"
6.Pink.44	03:09.5	03:09.9	"Yeah."
6.Green.38	03:09.6	03:11.3	"Is that okay if we put that one?"
6.Pink.45	03:10.1	03:13.6	"I wanted to first secure fire or secure warmth."
6.Blue.29	03:13.4	03:17.4	"Okay, so our first subjective is to like build the fire or stay warm."
6.Green.39	03:14.0	03:15.1	"Okay."
6.Pink.46	03:16.6	03:17.3	"Yeah."
6.Green.40	03:17.3	03:18.8	"Yeah, staying warm, we decided that."
6.Green.41	03:18.8	03:20.3	"So, all those will come first."
6.Pink.47	03:19.1	03:19.6	"Yeah."
6.Green.42	03:20.3	03:21.7	"So that was the wool one."
6.Green.43	03:21.7	03:23.3	"Is it okay if I put that one for two?"
6.Pink.48	03:23.2	03:24.0	"Sure."
6.Orange.12	03:23.4	03:23.9	"Yep."
6.Blue.30	03:23.4	03:24.1	"True."
6.Green.44	03:24.1	03:25.3	"Uh, where is, where is that?"
6.Pink.49	03:26.4	03:27.4	"It's up here."
6.Green.45	03:27.5	03:28.1	"There we go."
6.Green.46	03:28.1	03:28.8	"Okay."
6.Green.47	03:29.2	03:31.4	"Um, what are the other warmth ones that we could?"
6.Pink.50	03:31.2	03:33.1	"Uh, there was the cigarette lighter. "
6.Green.48	03:33.0	03:33.5	"Yeah."
6.Blue.31	03:33.2	03:34.5	"The whiskey."
6.Pink.51	03:33.3	03:34.1	"Uh."
6.Orange.13	03:33.3	03:34.3	"With the fluid."
6.Pink.52	03:34.4	03:34.9	"Yeah."
6.Green.49	03:35.1	03:36.6	"You can use the whiskey."
6.Blue.32	03:35.1	03:36.2	"You can use the whiskey."
6.Pink.53	03:35.4	03:38.1	"You can still -- you can still use the, uh --"
6.Orange.14	03:37.7	03:38.4	"Oh."
6.Blue.33	03:38.2	03:41.5	"You can use the spark in the whiskey to light it."
6.Green.50	03:39.1	03:40.3	"Oh."
6.Pink.54	03:39.7	03:41.0	"This part, yeah."
6.Orange.15	03:41.6	03:42.7	"I did not know that."
6.Green.51	03:41.8	03:45.3	"I didn't know whiskey cause I was like who needs whiskey, so I was like $."
6.Blue.34	03:43.8	03:44.6	"$"
6.Pink.55	03:44.7	03:48.9	"Uh, although, although there is a good, uh, something that I just remembered."
6.Blue.35	03:45.1	03:46.3	"I thought the same."
6.Green.52	03:46.1	03:47.1	"I didn't know that."
6.Green.53	03:47.2	03:48.3	"I would die first."
6.Orange.16	03:48.6	03:49.1	"Yeah."
6.Green.54	03:48.8	03:49.3	"So."
6.Pink.56	03:48.9	03:52.0	"Uh, you can create fire with steel wool and batteries."
6.Blue.36	03:52.4	03:53.7	"Oh true."
6.Orange.17	03:52.7	03:53.8	"Oh."
6.Pink.57	03:53.8	03:55.8	"If you get, uh, the steel wool around the battery."
6.Pink.58	03:55.8	03:57.8	"Or depending what type of battery you have."
6.Orange.18	03:57.0	03:57.5	"Yeah."
6.Green.55	03:57.1	03:58.4	"Batteries for what, sorry?"
6.Pink.59	03:58.0	03:59.8	"Uh, the batteries with a flashlight."
6.Orange.19	03:58.6	03:59.8	"Flashlight."
6.Blue.37	03:59.3	04:00.5	"From the flashlight."
6.Green.56	04:00.0	04:01.2	"Oh."
6.Pink.60	04:00.1	04:02.2	"You can create fire with that, so."
6.Blue.38	04:01.8	04:08.8	"Yeah, but even if it's a small, uh, battery, you can still use the lighter to sort of push it along."
6.Green.57	04:02.1	04:02.9	"Oh."
6.Pink.61	04:06.4	04:06.8	"Yep."
6.Pink.62	04:07.6	04:08.2	"Oh."
6.Green.58	04:08.4	04:10.1	"So, do we want to the lighter next then?"
6.Pink.63	04:08.7	04:09.2	"Yeah."
6.Pink.64	04:10.0	04:11.8	"Yeah, lighter next, definitely."
6.Green.59	04:10.7	04:11.3	"Okay."
6.Blue.39	04:11.3	04:12.0	"Yeah."
6.Green.60	04:12.3	04:13.5	"Lighter and then?"
6.Pink.65	04:13.8	04:14.7	"Uh, the newspaper."
6.Green.61	04:14.7	04:15.7	"And then newspaper?"
6.Orange.20	04:15.4	04:16.9	"Yeah cause you're gonna need kindling."
6.Green.62	04:15.8	04:16.3	"Kay."
6.Pink.66	04:16.9	04:17.4	"Mhm."
6.Green.63	04:17.1	04:17.7	"Perfect."
6.Blue.40	04:17.2	04:17.7	"Yeah."
6.Green.64	04:17.8	04:18.8	"Um."
6.Green.65	04:19.1	04:21.2	"And then did we want to do?"
6.Green.66	04:21.2	04:22.4	"Something else came up."
6.Pink.67	04:21.2	04:31.8	"Uh, I was thinking knife because, uh, even if, uh, newspaper i-it burns really fast, and we might need to get a little bit of wood going."
6.Green.67	04:23.1	04:23.8	"The knife?"
6.Blue.41	04:30.0	04:31.0	"Find some wood."
6.Green.68	04:31.2	04:32.6	"So the knife, okay?"
6.Blue.42	04:32.6	04:33.2	"Yeah."
6.Green.69	04:33.3	04:34.2	"Um."
6.Green.70	04:35.4	04:38.4	"And then maybe we should think about protection or?"
6.Pink.68	04:38.3	04:38.7	"Yeah."
6.Blue.43	04:38.4	04:38.9	"Yeah."
6.Pink.69	04:38.8	04:42.7	"The next thing -- the next group is just kind of really."
6.Green.71	04:39.7	04:40.3	"Yeah."
6.Green.72	04:42.8	04:43.7	"Staying safe."
6.Blue.44	04:43.3	04:43.9	"Yeah."
6.Pink.70	04:43.4	04:49.0	"Yeah, uh, something I should mention before we go further is that the whiskey should be the last."
6.Pink.71	04:49.2	04:52.9	"Cause alcohol makes you lose heat faster."
6.Blue.45	04:52.9	04:53.6	"Yeah."
6.Blue.46	04:53.9	04:56.4	"I had it up at fourth cause I was gonna --"
6.Pink.72	04:54.8	04:55.3	"Yeah."
6.Blue.47	04:56.6	04:58.4	"I was thinking of using it in the fire."
6.Green.73	04:57.0	05:01.9	"If you're thinking about the fire, but other -- if we're using the newspaper and the lighter, then it'll --"
6.Pink.73	04:59.0	05:00.2	"Oh, oh, that's true."
6.Blue.48	04:59.4	05:00.6	"But since --"
6.Blue.49	05:00.7	05:01.2	"Yeah."
6.Green.74	05:01.9	05:03.1	"So that'll be fifteen, then."
6.Pink.74	05:02.2	05:02.8	"Yeah."
6.Green.75	05:03.8	05:05.4	"Um, if everyone agrees with that."
6.Pink.75	05:05.0	05:05.6	"Mhm."
6.Orange.21	05:05.3	05:06.0	"Sure."
6.Blue.50	05:05.4	05:05.7	"Yeah."
6.Green.76	05:05.6	05:06.1	"Kay,"
6.Green.77	05:06.9	05:09.5	"Um, so next, do we wanna do?"
6.Pink.76	05:10.9	05:13.8	"I had the chocolate bar because I was thinking food."
6.Green.78	05:13.8	05:14.2	"Food."
6.Green.79	05:14.3	05:15.1	"Okay."
6.Blue.51	05:15.2	05:15.8	"Yeah."
6.Blue.52	05:16.1	05:19.2	"And it's easy to burn those calories and sort of, yeah."
6.Green.80	05:19.3	05:20.8	"Do you want to do chocolate bar then?"
6.Green.81	05:20.8	05:22.7	"Sure, okay, five."
6.Blue.53	05:22.7	05:26.5	"Yeah cause like for the first twelve hours, chocolate is good."
6.Pink.77	05:23.8	05:26.4	"Chocolate and shortening, those should be."
6.Green.82	05:25.9	05:26.8	"And the shortening?"
6.Pink.78	05:26.8	05:28.8	"Yeah, cause shortening is like thick fat."
6.Green.83	05:27.0	05:27.5	"Kay."
6.Blue.54	05:27.5	05:32.0	"Actually... I put the shortening, um, later on."
6.Green.84	05:31.7	05:32.3	"Same."
6.Blue.55	05:32.0	05:38.2	"Cause like if you think first twelve hours, chocolate you use it for fast energy and all of that."
6.Pink.79	05:34.8	05:35.4	"Mhm."
6.Pink.80	05:38.0	05:38.6	"Mhm."
6.Blue.56	05:38.2	05:41.6	"And then you can figure out like where you are and all of that."
6.Pink.81	05:40.8	05:42.6	"Oh, very, sure."
6.Green.85	05:41.3	05:42.2	"Yeah."
6.Blue.57	05:42.1	05:48.0	"And then if you have to spend the night, then the shortening is good for the over night, then."
6.Orange.22	05:42.2	05:44.6	"It's an oil so you can add it to a fire, too."
6.Pink.82	05:44.2	05:45.2	"That is true."
6.Pink.83	05:46.4	05:46.8	"Yeah."
6.Pink.84	05:48.4	05:48.9	"Yeah."
6.Green.86	05:48.7	05:49.7	"Okay, cool."
6.Green.87	05:49.7	05:51.2	"So, we'll do that one later."
6.Pink.85	05:51.1	05:51.7	"Mhm."
6.Green.88	05:51.4	05:55.0	"So after the chocolate bar, uh, where do we want to go from there?"
6.Pink.86	05:54.6	06:00.0	"Uh, I had had then... the air map and the compass like seven and eight."
6.Blue.58	05:59.7	06:00.3	"Yeah."
6.Pink.87	06:00.2	06:01.7	"Cause I feel like --"
6.Green.89	06:00.3	06:02.4	"That's for compass, seven."
6.Orange.23	06:01.6	06:02.1	"Yeah."
6.Pink.88	06:02.1	06:05.9	"Yeah, they both have to be together cause otherwise, we're not really doing much."
6.Green.90	06:02.4	06:04.8	"Um, and then the air map, okay."
6.Green.91	06:05.9	06:07.2	"Okay, that make sense."
6.Pink.89	06:07.7	06:10.9	"Unless, we want to, you know, stare at the sun to see where it goes."
6.Orange.24	06:10.4	06:10.9	"$"
6.Pink.90	06:10.9	06:13.1	"And then the luck of having a clear day."
6.Blue.59	06:13.1	06:14.0	"Yeah."
6.Blue.60	06:14.6	06:18.3	"Yeah, cause like first you stay warm, then you figure out where you are."
6.Pink.91	06:18.3	06:18.9	"Mhm."
6.Blue.61	06:18.9	06:21.6	"And then you figure out food if you have to stay too long."
6.Pink.92	06:21.0	06:21.6	"Yeah."
6.Pink.93	06:22.0	06:22.6	"Yeah."
6.Green.92	06:22.0	06:22.5	"Yeah."
6.Blue.62	06:22.8	06:33.0	"So I think after you have the compass and the n-newspaper, you could either use the rope to like build something to catch."
6.Orange.25	06:30.5	06:31.7	"I was going to say rope."
6.Blue.63	06:33.0	06:35.3	"Or use the pistol."
6.Blue.64	06:35.3	06:37.5	"But I don't really trust people with pistols."
6.Orange.26	06:35.6	06:37.6	"What about the pistol as the flare?"
6.Pink.94	06:36.8	06:37.4	"Mhm."
6.Orange.27	06:37.7	06:39.0	"Oh, I'm thinking as a flare."
6.Pink.95	06:37.7	06:38.5	"Yeah, that --"
6.Blue.65	06:39.4	06:40.2	"Oh."
6.Orange.28	06:39.6	06:40.6	"And shoot it."
6.Pink.96	06:39.8	06:43.3	"Oh, it's a point, uh, point forty-five caliber, that means bullets."
6.Green.93	06:40.7	06:41.5	"That's smart."
6.Blue.66	06:41.1	06:41.9	"Yeah."
6.Blue.67	06:42.8	06:43.3	"Yeah."
6.Green.94	06:43.4	06:48.6	"I honestly would do the gun next cause I would just like shoot something probably $."
6.Pink.97	06:46.7	06:51.2	"Uh, I was thinking with a knife, you can make a, uh, surprising amount of noise."
6.Green.95	06:50.6	06:52.6	"A knife too, yeah, would be --"
6.Blue.68	06:51.6	06:54.0	"Yeah, since a knife would already have a --"
6.Pink.98	06:52.4	06:55.0	"Cause you can also grab sticks and sharp."
6.Green.96	06:52.6	06:55.0	"Because you can, um, yeah, yeah."
6.Green.97	06:55.2	06:56.6	"But we have the knife."
6.Blue.69	06:56.2	06:57.6	"We already have knife."
6.Green.98	06:56.6	06:58.4	"Oh, we already have the knife, yeah."
6.Pink.99	06:56.8	06:58.1	"We already have the knife."
6.Blue.70	06:58.1	06:58.6	"Yeah."
6.Pink.100	06:58.4	06:59.0	"Uh, huh."
6.Green.99	06:58.8	06:59.8	"Um."
6.Blue.71	06:58.9	07:03.1	"So, I would use the rope to ... sort of make snares and all that."
6.Pink.101	07:01.2	07:02.7	"Yeah, the rope."
6.Green.100	07:02.5	07:03.1	"Kay."
6.Pink.102	07:02.9	07:05.1	"Rope would be good to go next."
6.Green.101	07:04.3	07:05.1	"Nine."
6.Blue.72	07:06.0	07:09.4	"Um, I-I don't really trust people with guns $ so."
6.Pink.103	07:08.7	07:09.4	"Yeah."
6.Green.102	07:09.5	07:13.9	"I like guns so I was just like, I would want, like, I would want the gun if I was out there."
6.Blue.73	07:10.0	07:11.5	"I'm kinda iffy about it."
6.Pink.104	07:13.7	07:14.5	"Exactly."
6.Green.103	07:13.9	07:15.4	"I would want to be the one holding it."
6.Pink.105	07:14.7	07:15.4	"Exactly."
6.Green.104	07:15.4	07:17.7	"Like I would get all freaked out at everyone $."
6.Pink.106	07:15.5	07:22.2	"But then, if we are -- they didn't say how many people are there, but if are a whole bunch of people, oh."
6.Orange.29	07:15.8	07:17.7	"$"
6.Blue.74	07:19.0	07:19.7	"Yeah."
6.Green.105	07:20.4	07:22.1	"Will we each get a gun, then?"
6.Pink.107	07:22.2	07:23.7	"No no no, it's only one gun."
6.Blue.75	07:22.3	07:24.0	"No, it's just one gun."
6.Orange.30	07:22.7	07:23.9	"Just one gun."
6.Green.106	07:23.4	07:24.4	"Only one gun."
6.Pink.108	07:24.0	07:25.4	"So when it doesn't say --"
6.Blue.76	07:24.4	07:26.9	"I would leave it with the person that knows how to use it."
6.Green.107	07:26.6	07:27.7	"No, that's what I mean."
6.Pink.109	07:26.9	07:27.5	"Exactly,"
6.Blue.77	07:27.2	07:27.9	"But."
6.Green.108	07:27.7	07:28.4	"Yeah, I wouldn't."
6.Green.109	07:28.4	07:33.3	"If one person was, um, trained on it, I will be like okay, you have that, in case of emergency."
6.Pink.110	07:30.0	07:30.9	"Yeah but --"
6.Pink.111	07:32.1	07:39.6	"But... but imagine, you're right after uh, a crash and you see a gun and like you're not bel-trusting people."
6.Blue.78	07:39.6	07:40.0	"Yeah."
6.Pink.112	07:40.0	07:40.6	"Uh."
6.Green.110	07:41.2	07:42.4	"That's true."
6.Pink.113	07:42.4	07:42.9	"Yeah."
6.Green.111	07:42.5	07:43.7	"That's true."
6.Blue.79	07:43.5	07:46.1	"Yeah, it's unlikely that they'll give it up."
6.Green.112	07:44.2	07:45.0	"Well you --"
6.Green.113	07:46.4	07:46.8	"Yeah."
6.Pink.114	07:46.8	07:47.3	"Exactly."
6.Green.114	07:46.8	07:50.3	"But, not like they're going to use it against you though because they're all working together."
6.Pink.115	07:48.3	07:53.1	"And how do you know the first person who finds it doesn't, you know, keep it for themselves?"
6.Green.115	07:50.3	07:51.1	"But you don't --"
6.Green.116	07:52.5	07:53.9	"Yeah and then not tell anyone."
6.Pink.116	07:53.6	07:54.3	"Mhm."
6.Green.117	07:53.9	07:54.6	"Oh."
6.Orange.31	07:54.8	07:55.8	"$"
6.Green.118	07:54.9	07:56.2	"Okay, drama."
6.Blue.80	07:56.2	07:57.4	"$"
6.Green.119	07:56.7	07:59.0	"Okay, so what, we don't wanna do the gun then?"
6.Pink.117	07:57.3	07:58.1	"[unclear]"
6.Pink.118	07:59.2	08:05.2	"Uh, I would rather have the gun lower cause I do understand it is a safety, especially for woods."
6.Blue.81	08:02.8	08:03.6	"Yeah."
6.Green.120	08:03.0	08:03.5	"Yeah."
6.Green.121	08:04.2	08:04.7	"Okay."
6.Green.122	08:05.6	08:06.7	"So, wait for that one."
6.Pink.119	08:06.6	08:07.2	"Mhm."
6.Green.123	08:06.7	08:10.9	"Do we wanna do maybe the... compress kit or?"
6.Pink.120	08:11.3	08:13.0	"Compress kit or flashlight."
6.Green.124	08:12.4	08:14.5	"Or flash -- that's what I was thinking, flashlight."
6.Orange.32	08:13.2	08:14.6	"I would say flashlight."
6.Pink.121	08:13.5	08:13.9	"Yeah."
6.Blue.82	08:14.0	08:16.8	"Yeah, flashlight and then the compress kit."
6.Pink.122	08:14.3	08:15.3	"Flashlight for sure."
6.Green.125	08:14.8	08:16.7	"Flashlight and then the compress kit."
6.Pink.123	08:16.5	08:17.1	"Mhm."
6.Green.126	08:16.8	08:17.4	"Okay."
6.Green.127	08:17.9	08:20.9	"And then we have... short --"
6.Blue.83	08:19.8	08:21.8	"I think then you can put the pistol."
6.Green.128	08:21.8	08:22.3	"Kay."
6.Green.129	08:22.4	08:24.1	"Eleven, twelve."
6.Green.130	08:24.1	08:25.3	"Eleven, oh, yeah."
6.Green.131	08:25.4	08:27.3	"And then ski poles and shortening."
6.Orange.33	08:25.6	08:26.8	"Ski poles?"
6.Green.132	08:27.3	08:29.0	"So, shortening then ski poles?"
6.Blue.84	08:27.6	08:29.2	"The shortening definitely."
6.Pink.124	08:29.0	08:29.9	"Yeah."
6.Green.133	08:30.1	08:31.5	"Um, thirteen."
6.Blue.85	08:30.9	08:33.5	"I don't really know what I would do with ski poles."
6.Green.134	08:33.7	08:36.2	"You can find something to do, like."
6.Pink.125	08:33.8	08:34.4	"Uh."
6.Pink.126	08:35.7	08:39.0	"It -- the thing is, it's only two."
6.Pink.127	08:39.4	08:42.4	"Because if everybody had a pair, then that helps walking."
6.Blue.86	08:42.2	08:43.0	"Yeah."
6.Green.135	08:42.5	08:43.1	"Yeah."
6.Pink.128	08:43.2	08:47.3	"Uh, but if we-we had someone that has problem walking, that could use it."
6.Pink.129	08:47.3	08:50.5	"Uh, could be like a makeshift weapon."
6.Pink.130	08:50.7	08:51.2	"I don't know."
6.Green.136	08:51.3	08:52.8	"You could wack someone on the head with that."
6.Pink.131	08:52.8	08:54.5	"Or something in the head."
6.Orange.34	08:54.3	08:56.3	"Something or an animal $."
6.Blue.87	08:54.5	08:57.3	"Because we need to make a tourniquet, I guess $."
6.Pink.132	08:57.3	09:04.0	"I guess, or if someone breaks a... uh, broken leg or broken arm, broken, uh, that thing."
6.Orange.35	08:59.9	09:01.3	"Broken leg or something?"
6.Blue.88	09:00.2	09:01.2	"Oh yeah."
6.Orange.36	09:01.5	09:02.0	"Broken."
6.Green.137	09:04.0	09:04.5	"Yeah."
6.Blue.89	09:04.9	09:05.4	"Yeah."
6.Green.138	09:05.3	09:05.8	"Okay."
6.Blue.90	09:05.7	09:07.3	"Secondary precautions."
6.Pink.133	09:05.8	09:06.6	"Yep."
6.Blue.91	09:07.7	09:08.4	"Awesome."
6.Pink.134	09:08.0	09:10.0	"So, everybody agrees with the list?"
6.Green.139	09:09.4	09:10.4	"Mhm."
6.Orange.37	09:10.0	09:10.4	"I think so, yeah."
6.Blue.92	09:10.5	09:11.1	"Yeah. "
6.Pink.135	09:10.8	09:11.6	"Yeah."
