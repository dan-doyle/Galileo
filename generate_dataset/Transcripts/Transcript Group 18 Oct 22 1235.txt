18.Pink.4	00:12.9	00:13.2	"Yeah."
18.Orange.3	00:13.4	00:15.9	"I just said compass because I feel like you don't know where to go."
18.Orange.4	00:15.9	00:22.4	"Even if you have the extra clothes you won't be able to survive there for long enough unless you know where to start going towards."
18.Orange.5	00:22.8	00:23.9	"That's the only reason why."

18.Blue.3	00:34.5	00:35.1	"Yeah."
18.Orange.8	00:35.9	00:36.8	"Yeah, you're right."

18.Blue.6	00:46.6	00:47.8	"I said the knife."
18.Pink.11	00:47.8	00:48.2	"Okay."
18.Blue.7	00:48.8	00:49.4	"Um."

18.Blue.10	01:00.9	01:01.5	"Yeah."
18.Pink.16	01:01.3	01:06.0	"But-but possibly that wouldn't be very helpful for like you didn't have anything to make a fire."
18.Pink.17	01:06.0	01:06.6	"I don't know."
18.Pink.18	01:06.6	01:08.1	"Cause then I can --"

18.Orange.12	01:15.2	01:17.8	"Again, it's just like an energy thing."
18.Pink.20	01:18.1	01:19.7	"Okay, that makes sense."
18.Orange.13	01:19.1	01:21.0	"Not everyone is like full on energy."
18.Pink.21	01:21.3	01:21.8	"Yeah."

18.Blue.14	01:57.8	01:58.2	"Yeah."
18.Pink.26	02:02.5	02:03.0	"Yeah."
18.Blue.15	02:03.1	02:03.5	"Yeah."
18.Orange.16	02:03.4	02:09.4	"And I'm kind of I'm a little bit low on iron so I get super cold and it really helps me."

18.Orange.18	02:11.6	02:13.5	"It might just be fifteenth for most people."
18.Pink.29	02:13.6	02:14.1	"Yeah."
18.Blue.16	02:15.7	02:19.9	"Especially if you're like hungry or something and you need that extra energy booster, yeah."
18.Pink.30	02:18.9	02:19.5	"Yeah, true."
18.Pink.31	02:19.5	02:20.6	"We can put that as three."

18.Orange.23	02:49.7	02:51.7	"I guess it's like priorities."
18.Orange.24	02:51.7	02:55.5	"I'm like need the compass get out of the way first and you're like shelter first. "
18.Pink.41	02:53.5	03:02.2	"$ Yeah, I'm just saying like if you need to build something to like shelter you from like the wind or anything like that, get yourself like."

18.Blue.25	03:19.8	03:21.9	"That's when I said the thirty foot rope."
18.Orange.29	03:22.0	03:23.2	"That's when I said knife."

18.Orange.30	03:58.3	04:00.9	"You would need the knife to cut the rope too right?"
18.Pink.51	04:01.0	04:03.2	"Yeah, well, yeah you need the knife to cut the rope."
18.Orange.31	04:02.5	04:06.7	"And then it's a thick forest so you'll probably need the knife to [unclear]."

18.Pink.56	04:22.8	04:23.7	"That was easy."
18.Pink.57	04:24.2	04:29.8	"No, I just thought like it's not like high up in the priorities, but like it is pretty --"
18.Orange.33	04:29.0	04:32.0	"Don't really want to wait till it's minus forty degrees."
18.Blue.34	04:32.1	04:32.5	"Yeah."
18.Pink.58	04:32.4	04:35.9	"And yeah you can't see in the dark and everything, so."

18.Pink.75	05:52.4	05:53.5	"So we can put that as eight."
18.Orange.44	05:54.2	05:56.7	"I don't know why you'll need a ball of steel wool."
18.Orange.45	05:57.3	05:58.6	"What are you going to do with a ball?"

18.Pink.86	06:42.1	06:43.6	"I don't know."
18.Orange.52	06:43.0	06:44.6	"Plastic is [unclear]."

18.Pink.94	07:07.3	07:09.1	"Like a type of fat."
18.Orange.55	07:09.2	07:22.1	"What about ski poles cause what if like there's someone who knows how to ski really well and we're like we need to get to that place where people are and so maybe like a few people or like just one person goes ahead and gets help."
18.Orange.56	07:22.5	07:26.8	"Cause like maybe babies can't move this fast or like moms maybe someone's pregnant."
18.Blue.51	07:26.8	07:31.9	"I was thinking like for the ski poles like maybe for like hiking hi-hiking terrain or something."
18.Pink.95	07:28.5	07:28.9	"Yeah."
18.Orange.57	07:31.3	07:32.7	"But there's only two of them."

18.Blue.53	07:43.3	07:44.4	"yeah like [unclear]."
18.Blue.54	07:44.4	07:47.9	"It's not super important but like just to like hike around to terrain maybe."
18.Pink.98	07:47.9	07:50.0	"No yeah that makes sense yeah."
18.Pink.99	07:50.1	07:53.2	"Like if -- and plus if someone got injured or something like that."

18.Pink.103	08:07.6	08:10.0	"The poles or what-what did you have again?"
18.Orange.60	08:09.0	08:12.7	"I don't think my reasoning is all that justified here."
18.Pink.104	08:12.9	08:13.9	"Which one was yours?"
18.Orange.61	08:13.9	08:16.4	"I put the ski poles as ten."
18.Pink.105	08:14.0	08:16.4	"You put the -- you put the ski poles."
18.Pink.106	08:16.4	08:17.4	"And you put?"
18.Blue.56	08:17.6	08:18.4	"For the ten?"
18.Pink.107	08:18.4	08:18.7	"Yeah."
18.Blue.57	08:18.7	08:21.5	"I said the can of shortening but I kind of just randomly put that."
18.Pink.108	08:21.5	08:22.9	"Okay yeah, that's my ten as well."
18.Pink.109	08:23.5	08:25.6	"But yeah, I think the ski poles are --"
18.Pink.110	08:26.6	08:27.7	"I think that's a good idea."
18.Blue.58	08:29.5	08:30.9	"You can hike around."
18.Pink.111	08:30.6	08:32.0	"Yeah $."
18.Pink.112	08:33.0	08:34.2	"Okay, eleven."
18.Pink.113	08:37.7	08:39.9	"Eleven was the pistol for me."
18.Pink.114	08:39.9	08:41.0	"[unclear]"
18.Orange.62	08:40.3	08:44.4	"I just put rope at eleven because I was just kind of what is all this."
18.Pink.115	08:44.2	08:44.7	"Yeah."
18.Orange.63	08:44.4	08:46.7	"Cause a few of the words confused me."
18.Orange.64	08:46.7	08:48.1	"So that's the only reason."
18.Pink.116	08:46.8	08:47.4	"Mhm."
18.Pink.117	08:49.7	08:50.9	"What did you have for eleven?"
18.Blue.59	08:50.9	08:51.7	"I did whiskey."
18.Pink.118	08:51.7	08:55.2	"$ that was my fourteen."
18.Orange.65	08:53.6	08:55.6	"I put whiskey as twelve."
18.Orange.66	08:55.6	08:57.5	"I don't -- what could we use it for?"
18.Blue.60	08:58.4	08:58.9	"I mean."
18.Blue.61	08:59.7	09:01.7	"Could you not use it to start a fire?"
18.Pink.119	09:01.9	09:03.7	"Yeah, you could you could."
18.Orange.67	09:02.0	09:06.1	"Yeah, but we have the -- but the -- oh yeah. "
18.Blue.62	09:16.8	09:18.8	"The fire is meh."
18.Pink.120	09:20.0	09:24.0	"We didn't put -- we haven't put down the cigarette lighter without the fluid yet."
18.Pink.121	09:24.3	09:25.5	"I just realized that."
18.Blue.63	09:25.1	09:29.7	"I had that last because it's without fluid right, so."
18.Pink.122	09:26.7	09:27.3	"What?"
18.Pink.123	09:29.2	09:30.4	"We still have the lighter."
18.Pink.124	09:30.8	09:31.9	"Oh wait, it's without fluid."
18.Pink.125	09:31.9	09:32.5	"Never mind."
18.Blue.64	09:32.0	09:32.6	"Yeah."
18.Pink.126	09:32.5	09:33.3	"Then that doesn't work."
18.Pink.127	09:35.3	09:38.5	"Okay yeah yeah that's stupid [unclear]."
18.Pink.128	09:38.5	09:39.7	"Should we put that as fifteen?"
18.Blue.65	09:40.1	09:42.0	"That's what mine was [unclear]."
18.Pink.129	09:41.7	09:42.1	"Yeah."
18.Blue.66	09:43.5	09:45.4	"I mean unless there was some way to --"
18.Pink.130	09:46.4	09:48.3	"I'm not sure what you'll do with this."
18.Orange.68	09:47.3	09:54.5	"You could use one of the extra shirts to put on a wood stick and then light the fire like [unclear] $."
18.Pink.131	09:52.8	09:54.9	"$"
18.Orange.69	09:54.5	09:58.1	"$ that's why I thought -- that's why I put it high up."
18.Pink.132	09:59.2	09:59.8	"Oh wait."
18.Pink.133	10:01.9	10:05.9	"Um, yeah, final [unclear]."
18.Pink.134	10:06.4	10:07.4	"Let's put that nine."
18.Pink.135	10:07.4	10:15.6	"But for ten or eleven, should we just put [unclear]."
18.Pink.136	10:22.4	10:24.2	"Compress kit."
18.Pink.137	10:26.0	10:28.8	"You said you had the whiskey?"
18.Blue.67	10:28.9	10:29.5	"Uh, what?"
18.Pink.138	10:29.5	10:30.7	"For eleven."
18.Blue.68	10:30.4	10:32.2	"Eleven, yeah I had whiskey."
18.Blue.69	10:32.3	10:33.2	"Eleven."
18.Pink.139	10:34.0	10:37.1	"I think that that's-that's reasonable."
18.Blue.70	10:41.4	10:42.4	"What we have for ten?"
18.Blue.71	10:42.4	10:43.4	"What did you put for ten?"
18.Pink.140	10:43.4	10:44.7	"It was the can of shortening."
18.Pink.141	10:47.5	10:50.3	"But I don't think that one's really important."
18.Orange.70	10:50.0	10:53.3	"Do we have the sectional air map as last then?"
18.Pink.142	10:55.4	10:56.8	"Yeah."
18.Pink.143	10:59.4	11:03.2	"Where should we rank the sectional air map then?"
18.Blue.72	11:04.5	11:05.2	"Um."
18.Pink.144	11:04.6	11:07.4	"And we still don't have the compass down as well."
18.Orange.71	11:07.9	11:08.4	"Really?"
18.Blue.73	11:08.3	11:09.4	"We don't have compass, no. "
18.Orange.72	11:10.1	11:15.2	"I think it's -- it should be one of the first ones cause we're northwest of a small town."
18.Orange.73	11:15.2	11:16.7	"How are we going to go from there?"
18.Pink.145	11:17.0	11:18.2	"Should we replace it?"
18.Pink.146	11:18.2	11:21.8	"Should we switch it with the pistol?"
18.Pink.147	11:22.4	11:23.5	"The pistol's six."
18.Pink.148	11:25.4	11:27.1	"Cause we have one."
18.Blue.74	11:27.1	11:28.8	"What's um?"
18.Orange.74	11:27.7	11:31.3	"A pistol could be good for attracting attention and hunting."
18.Pink.149	11:30.9	11:31.8	"True."
18.Pink.150	11:34.4	11:39.4	"Um, and we have two as the chocolate bar."
18.Blue.75	11:37.8	11:40.2	"What's -- what do you have for five?"
18.Pink.151	11:40.2	11:41.8	"For five, we have the flashlight."
18.Pink.152	11:43.1	11:44.2	"Should we switch?"
18.Blue.76	11:44.5	11:48.2	"Yeah, I think we should switch the map with the flashlight. "
18.Pink.153	11:45.0	11:46.0	"I think we should switch."
18.Blue.77	11:48.2	11:52.9	"Cause I think I-I think what this is is that it's a map of your area."
18.Pink.154	11:52.8	11:53.4	"Yeah."
18.Pink.155	11:54.1	11:54.9	"Okay."
18.Blue.78	11:56.1	11:59.7	"Which could be kind of important."
18.Pink.156	11:59.7	12:00.1	"Yeah."
18.Orange.75	11:59.8	12:04.4	"Oh, yeah it's the air map so would be like the plane."
18.Blue.79	12:04.5	12:05.2	"Yeah."
18.Orange.76	12:07.3	12:10.2	"So we should put compass and the air map together?"
18.Blue.80	12:10.5	12:11.4	"Yeah, I think so."
18.Blue.81	12:11.4	12:12.7	"[unclear]"
18.Pink.157	12:13.0	12:14.5	"Okay, so we have."
18.Pink.158	12:16.0	12:18.0	"So we have to switch up some stuff now."
18.Pink.159	12:18.6	12:20.1	"Compass has no number."
18.Pink.160	12:20.1	12:21.5	"Flashlight was five."
18.Pink.161	12:22.8	12:24.2	"What would you guys consider?"
18.Pink.162	12:24.2	12:27.1	"And then the second one was the chocolate bar."
18.Pink.163	12:27.6	12:29.1	"And then three was a knife."
18.Pink.164	12:29.1	12:30.2	"Four was rope."
18.Orange.77	12:30.2	12:31.1	"What was seven?"
18.Pink.165	12:31.1	12:33.0	"Seven was newspaper."
18.Orange.78	12:33.4	12:35.4	"Could we put newspaper at eight?"
18.Pink.166	12:35.4	12:36.0	"Eight?"
18.Pink.167	12:36.8	12:38.9	"Then that bumps the compress kit."
18.Blue.82	12:39.0	12:39.6	"Okay."
18.Pink.168	12:40.2	12:42.6	"We would have to bump them all up."
18.Pink.169	12:43.3	12:45.6	"I guess um."
18.Pink.170	12:51.0	12:55.7	"Oh, we just changed [unclear]."
18.Pink.171	12:57.1	12:59.4	"Oh god $."
18.Pink.172	13:00.1	13:04.6	"Okay, then we have the compress kit which is also eight."
18.Pink.173	13:04.6	13:07.0	"So where would you guys want to move that one to?"
18.Orange.79	13:07.0	13:08.1	"Wait, I have a question."
18.Orange.80	13:08.1	13:11.1	"How long do you think it would take to travel eighty miles?"
18.Blue.83	13:13.2	13:14.4	"A long time I think."
18.Blue.84	13:14.5	13:15.4	"It is."
18.Orange.81	13:14.5	13:15.3	"How long?"
18.Pink.174	13:15.7	13:17.2	"Especially if it's in snow."
18.Pink.175	13:19.2	13:22.1	"And you don't know where you're going $."
18.Orange.82	13:20.5	13:22.8	"You're definitely going to need the flashlight."
18.Pink.176	13:22.8	13:23.5	"Yeah."
18.Pink.177	13:24.8	13:26.5	"So, we have that as five."
18.Orange.83	13:25.7	13:31.6	"And we also going to need the newspaper cause as much as it doesn't contribute to you moving further."
18.Pink.178	13:30.4	13:30.9	"Yeah."
18.Blue.85	13:31.1	13:31.8	"Yeah."
18.Orange.84	13:32.1	13:34.0	"You literally can't survive."
18.Blue.86	13:34.2	13:37.2	"And you need the map to know the direction."
18.Orange.85	13:35.5	13:38.2	"So maybe the map should be after."
18.Blue.87	13:37.3	13:37.8	"Yeah."
18.Pink.179	13:38.3	13:40.8	"So, the map should be nine."
18.Orange.86	13:43.1	13:45.1	"Could you go in order again?"
18.Orange.87	13:45.1	13:46.2	"I want to check."
18.Pink.180	13:45.9	13:49.0	"So, one is the extra shirt and pants for each survivor."
18.Pink.181	13:49.0	13:51.2	"So that's good, we all agree on that."
18.Pink.182	13:51.3	13:53.6	"Two is the family sized chocolate bar."
18.Pink.183	13:54.1	13:55.3	"Should we keep that?"
18.Pink.184	13:55.7	13:58.7	"I know I don't think -- I think we should switch that one out."
18.Blue.88	13:56.4	13:57.3	"I don't know."
18.Blue.89	13:58.7	14:01.7	"I think the map and the compass would are probably more important."
18.Pink.185	14:01.1	14:01.8	"Yeah."
18.Pink.186	14:02.0	14:06.0	"So should we do two as the?"
18.Orange.88	14:07.9	14:10.7	"Ski poles are way more important now, I guess."
18.Blue.90	14:12.7	14:15.1	"Cause you can actually put them in the snow now."
18.Pink.187	14:14.4	14:15.2	"Yeah."
18.Pink.188	14:16.0	14:19.0	"So should we put the ski poles as two or no?"
18.Blue.91	14:19.0	14:19.9	"Yeah, do two."
18.Orange.89	14:19.9	14:20.5	"Yeah, same."
18.Pink.189	14:23.2	14:23.8	"Uh."
18.Pink.190	14:26.0	14:26.5	"Two."
18.Pink.191	14:26.5	14:29.9	"And then for three, we have the knife."
18.Pink.192	14:29.9	14:30.7	"Should we keep that?"
18.Blue.92	14:30.8	14:31.3	"Yes."
18.Pink.193	14:31.4	14:34.3	"And then four, thirty feet of rope."
18.Blue.93	14:35.4	14:36.4	"Sure $."
18.Pink.194	14:36.4	14:37.8	"$"
18.Pink.195	14:38.5	14:40.7	"Five, the flashlight with batteries."
18.Pink.196	14:41.3	14:44.5	"And then six is the loaded pistol."
18.Blue.94	14:42.8	14:43.5	"Yeah."
18.Orange.90	14:44.2	14:44.9	"Definitely."
18.Pink.197	14:45.2	14:47.3	"And then we don't have a seven now."
18.Pink.198	14:47.6	14:49.8	"So should we make the compass seven?"
18.Blue.95	14:49.5	14:49.9	"Yes."
18.Pink.199	14:50.0	14:50.4	"Okay."
18.Blue.96	14:50.6	14:53.6	"And then, uh, air map eight."
18.Orange.91	14:51.7	14:53.0	"Air map eight."
18.Pink.200	14:52.3	14:53.3	"Eight, we have."
18.Pink.201	14:53.8	14:56.9	"Air map, eight."
18.Pink.202	14:58.7	15:01.8	"And then nine, should be newspaper then?"
18.Pink.203	15:03.9	15:05.0	"And then [unclear]."
18.Pink.204	15:05.0	15:07.7	"Oh shoot, the ball of steel wool is nine."
18.Pink.205	15:07.9	15:08.8	"Put it as."
18.Orange.92	15:09.7	15:11.4	"That one's probably not as important."
18.Blue.97	15:10.0	15:12.5	"Th -- do like thirteen or something."
18.Pink.206	15:12.1	15:12.8	"Thirteen."
18.Blue.98	15:12.6	15:13.1	"Yeah."
18.Pink.207	15:15.2	15:16.6	"Oh and so."
