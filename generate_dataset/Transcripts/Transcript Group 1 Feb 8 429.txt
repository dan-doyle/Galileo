1.Blue.11	00:35.4	00:37.8	"Yeah, but I was just thinking more of --"

1.Green.10	01:15.9	01:17.5	"I did the, uh, map."
1.Green.11	01:18.0	01:19.2	"Sectional air map."
1.Blue.19	01:20.2	01:23.6	"I did the, um, whiskey."

1.Pink.25	01:46.4	01:46.9	"Will it?"
1.Pink.26	01:47.0	01:49.0	"Okay, well that's smart."

1.Blue.46	02:35.4	02:37.3	"I was thinking like bears and stuff."
1.Blue.47	02:37.3	02:38.3	"I don't know."
1.Pink.39	02:37.6	02:39.4	"You could flashlight fish."

1.Blue.53	03:08.7	03:09.9	"Compass and the map."
1.Blue.54	03:09.9	03:11.6	"Yeah I guess that makes sense."

1.Pink.54	03:39.5	03:39.9	"Mm."
1.Green.32	03:42.2	03:46.4	"Was there anything on here that we haven't already gotten that we all wanted?"
1.Pink.55	03:45.0	03:46.4	"That was higher?"
1.Pink.56	03:47.2	03:49.5	"I did the pistol as higher."
1.Pink.57	03:51.6	03:53.5	"But it's not really necessary."

1.Pink.58	03:55.7	03:56.4	"Mhm."

1.Blue.105	06:57.7	07:00.2	"But could it be used as a weapon too?"
1.Green.70	06:59.9	07:05.4	"It-it could be used as a weapon but ski poles and sticks look very similar."
1.Blue.106	07:01.2	07:02.5	"But we already have --"
1.Blue.107	07:04.8	07:05.5	"Yeah."
