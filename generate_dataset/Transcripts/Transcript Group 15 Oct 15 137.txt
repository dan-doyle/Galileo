15.Purple.1	00:04.5	00:05.7	"I put compass."
15.Purple.2	00:05.7	00:10.4	"Um, I don't even know why I chose it, I just thought it would be useful, to be honest $ like."
15.Orange.2	00:09.2	00:11.1	"$"
15.Purple.3	00:10.4	00:11.1	"I don't know."
15.Purple.4	00:11.1	00:17.0	"I thought about like where you are and like basic survival and I figure that compass would be helpful."
15.Purple.5	00:17.0	00:17.8	"I don't know."
15.Yellow.1	00:18.5	00:19.0	"Okay."
15.Purple.6	00:19.1	00:19.8	"What did you have?"
15.Yellow.2	00:19.8	00:29.7	"Uh, I picked the-the knife as my number one for the fact that you can have as long purposes for it and, uh, cutting, shaving stuff, more stuff like that."
15.Purple.7	00:22.3	00:22.8	"Okay."
15.Purple.8	00:24.7	00:25.2	"Yeah."
15.Purple.9	00:29.0	00:29.4	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.3	00:29.7	00:38.9	"Um, but like the compass is useful cause it says like the eighty kilometers nor-northwest whatever being used other things for landmarks to find directions."
15.Purple.10	00:34.2	00:36.2	"Yeah, exactly, that's what I was thinking."
15.Purple.11	00:38.2	00:38.8	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.4	00:38.9	00:49.3	"So and I think if you if you did know the town like the knife could help you survive the longest because [unclear]."

15.Blue.1	00:50.6	00:53.2	"Oh sorry, I was actually going to ask everyone a question."
15.Blue.2	00:53.2	00:58.5	"And just say does anyone have any like camping or like general survival skills?"
15.Blue.3	00:58.5	00:58.8	"Okay."
15.Blue.4	00:58.8	01:06.6	"Cause like for me, um I-I've been to anatomy and physiology and that kind of stuff so I actually picked clothing for everyone."
15.Blue.5	01:07.0	01:10.6	"Cause in my opinion is you're going to get less hungry if you're not freezing."
15.Blue.6	01:10.6	01:13.4	"Cause you're warm enough, so you're not shivering and burning c-calories."
15.Blue.7	01:13.4	01:14.4	"Like you don't need to."
15.Blue.8	01:14.4	01:16.4	"You can delayer if you're too hot."
15.Blue.9	01:16.4	01:17.5	"Um, so."
15.Yellow.5	01:16.5	01:19.5	"It said you are dressed in winter clothing as well."
15.Blue.10	01:19.7	01:23.8	"Right but negative twenty-five degrees is very cold $."

15.Yellow.7	01:23.9	01:24.4	"[unclear]"
15.Yellow.8	01:24.9	01:29.0	"At that, yeah, at that temperature you need to have a shelter and fire [unclear]."
15.Blue.12	01:26.4	01:26.8	"Yeah."
15.Purple.19	01:26.4	01:26.8	"Yeah."
15.Orange.4	01:26.5	01:27.3	"$"
15.Blue.13	01:28.3	01:33.2	"So to me, that was my first thing cause I mean when you look at how much food you have."
15.Purple.20	01:31.8	01:34.5	"Yeah, yeah, that makes sense, yeah."
15.Blue.14	01:33.2	01:34.7	"I mean, obviously you can hunt."
15.Blue.15	01:34.7	01:35.2	"I don't know."
15.Yellow.9	01:35.1	01:35.8	"Yeah."
15.Blue.16	01:35.2	01:37.2	"I was just [unclear] $."
15.Orange.5	01:36.2	01:37.7	"$"
15.Purple.21	01:36.7	01:37.1	"Yeah."
15.Orange.6	01:38.4	01:47.9	"Um, I also put the compass, uh, just because, uh, from my experience, I'm actually from Manitoba area, so I know it's not too threatening of an area."
15.Purple.22	01:38.5	01:39.3	"What about you?"
15.Blue.17	01:44.9	01:45.7	"Oh, nice."
15.Orange.7	01:47.9	01:50.0	"It's just like the cold's going to get you mostly."
15.Orange.8	01:50.0	01:53.7	"Um, so I think as long as you have like a compass, I think it you'll be like good to go."
15.Purple.23	01:54.0	01:54.6	"Okay."
15.Orange.9	01:54.6	01:55.6	"I think, yeah."
15.Orange.10	01:55.6	01:56.9	"$"
15.Purple.24	01:59.3	02:02.5	"Okay, so maybe we should like rank like what's the most important."
15.Purple.25	02:02.9	02:04.6	"Like threat wise."
15.Blue.18	02:04.6	02:13.7	"Hm, well, I was going to say why don't -- why don't we see maybe what like the top three are maybe [unclear] if we have similarities, we can kind of go from there."
15.Purple.26	02:05.4	02:06.4	"You know what I mean?"
15.Purple.27	02:09.8	02:12.3	"Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

15.Purple.29	02:14.1	02:14.5	"Okay."
15.Yellow.12	02:14.5	02:16.1	"My number two was compass."
15.Purple.30	02:16.1	02:16.4	"Yeah."
15.Purple.31	02:16.4	02:18.2	"My number two was knife, so."
15.Orange.12	02:19.1	02:21.7	"Uh, my number two was the extra shirt and pants."
15.Purple.32	02:21.1	02:21.6	"Okay."
15.Blue.20	02:21.2	02:24.5	"Oh, my second was food $."

15.Purple.33	02:23.0	02:23.7	"Oh, yeah?"
15.Blue.21	02:24.5	02:25.5	"Okay, so what do we --"
15.Blue.22	02:25.5	02:29.0	"We're left with knife, um, compass."
15.Orange.14	02:27.5	02:28.1	"Compass."
15.Purple.34	02:27.7	02:28.5	"Compass."
15.Purple.35	02:29.0	02:29.5	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.13	02:29.0	02:29.4	"Mhm."
15.Blue.23	02:29.9	02:32.2	"And then sort of the layers."
15.Blue.24	02:32.3	02:33.2	"But okay."
15.Yellow.14	02:34.4	02:41.3	"Uh, for number three, I picked the cigarette lighter without fluid cause you can still use the flint to spark the knife."
15.Blue.25	02:39.1	02:39.6	"Mhm."
15.Purple.36	02:40.5	02:42.9	"I chose that as well for number three."

15.Orange.16	02:43.6	02:45.1	"That's my number five."
15.Orange.17	02:45.2	02:48.7	"Uh, my number three is food [unclear]."
15.Yellow.15	02:45.2	02:46.0	"$"
15.Purple.37	02:47.4	02:47.9	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.16	02:47.7	02:48.4	"Oh, okay."
15.Blue.26	02:48.7	02:50.4	"And my number three is the knife."
15.Purple.38	02:50.4	02:51.0	"Yeah."
15.Blue.27	02:50.9	02:56.4	"And and then I was thinking of yeah then the ne-my cause my next one to follow that is cigarette lighter."
15.Yellow.17	02:51.1	02:52.2	"Oh, yeah?"
15.Purple.39	02:55.2	02:55.8	"Yeah."
15.Purple.40	02:55.9	03:02.6	"Okay, so I feel like we have the compass, and knife and then clothing mostly for the top three."
15.Orange.18	03:02.9	03:03.5	"Mhm."
15.Purple.41	03:03.5	03:04.2	"Right?"
15.Yellow.18	03:04.2	03:04.5	"Yeah."
15.Blue.28	03:04.4	03:04.9	"Mhm."
15.Purple.42	03:05.0	03:08.1	"So, what do we think of those three would be the number one?"
15.Purple.43	03:09.2	03:11.6	"I kind of agree with you with clothing, to be honest with you."
15.Blue.29	03:11.6	03:21.1	"What I was going to say too I feel like I'm with the group I don't -- I'm not really concerned about where I am like I think I would be more worried about like right now and how you're going to get from point A to point --"
15.Purple.44	03:20.5	03:20.9	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.19	03:21.0	03:21.4	"Yeah."
15.Blue.30	03:21.1	03:21.8	"Right?"
15.Blue.31	03:21.9	03:24.9	"Um, but $."
15.Purple.45	03:23.6	03:31.3	"Yeah, but you also, or I don't know... for the how many people are in the group like you could also use body heat and stuff too, but like."
15.Blue.32	03:28.5	03:29.1	"Mhm."
15.Blue.33	03:31.1	03:32.1	"[unclear]"
15.Purple.46	03:31.6	03:32.8	"Yeah, you know what I mean."
15.Yellow.20	03:32.4	03:32.9	"Yeah."
15.Blue.34	03:32.5	03:33.2	"$"
15.Purple.47	03:33.0	03:39.2	"And you still have the frame of the, um, plane as well, so you could all like huddle in there."
15.Blue.35	03:35.1	03:36.0	"Oops, sorry."
15.Purple.48	03:40.0	03:41.1	"The warmth too."
15.Yellow.21	03:40.1	03:40.6	"True."
15.Purple.49	03:41.1	03:41.7	"You know what I mean?"
15.Yellow.22	03:41.7	03:45.4	"Another thing is like the knife can help you like cut like branches and stuff."
15.Yellow.23	03:45.4	03:48.8	"Because we learned how to, uh, make like tipis essentially."
15.Blue.36	03:48.7	03:49.1	"Mhm."
15.Purple.50	03:48.8	03:49.5	"Oh."
15.Yellow.24	03:48.8	03:51.1	"Out of just like branches and leaves and all that."
15.Yellow.25	03:51.1	03:53.4	"So you can make yourself a shelter just using the knife."
15.Purple.51	03:52.3	03:53.0	"Yeah, yeah."
15.Yellow.26	03:53.4	03:55.6	"Where it would be very very hard to do it with bare hands. "
15.Yellow.27	03:55.7	04:04.4	"So if I mean, hav-I think with that kind of temperature like extra clothes will help a bit for longer if you're actually like making it through the forest."
15.Purple.52	03:56.5	03:57.1	"True."
15.Purple.53	03:59.6	04:00.0	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.28	04:04.4	04:09.1	"But once it comes down to night, if you don't have shelter, clothes won't help you."
15.Purple.54	04:05.2	04:06.2	"Mhm, mhm."
15.Orange.19	04:06.2	04:06.8	"Mhm."
15.Orange.20	04:07.6	04:09.5	"It does say it is pretty early though."
15.Purple.55	04:09.4	04:09.8	"Yeah."
15.Orange.21	04:09.5	04:13.3	"It is like eleven thirty, so I mean you like have all day kinda of thing to."
15.Yellow.29	04:11.5	04:12.1	"Yeah."
15.Blue.37	04:12.9	04:13.3	"Mhm."
15.Purple.56	04:14.1	04:14.9	"I don't know."
15.Purple.57	04:15.7	04:16.4	"I don't know."
15.Blue.38	04:16.5	04:18.0	"So, like would we --"
15.Orange.22	04:17.4	04:24.9	"But we're -- if we're like trying like get out of the cold, like how far can we travel to like without having to like stop and?"
15.Blue.39	04:23.8	04:25.0	"Well that's what I was going to say."
15.Blue.40	04:25.0	04:25.9	"You have to decide."
15.Blue.41	04:25.9	04:26.9	"Are you staying?"
15.Orange.23	04:25.9	04:27.1	"Cause you're in Manitoba."
15.Blue.42	04:26.9	04:29.6	"Cause if you're staying, then shelter would come first."
15.Purple.58	04:27.0	04:28.3	"That's the thing, yeah."
15.Orange.24	04:27.1	04:28.5	"$"
15.Blue.43	04:29.6	04:32.6	"But if you are going then the shelter will come later."
15.Purple.59	04:30.2	04:31.0	"That's the thing."
15.Purple.60	04:32.5	04:33.1	"Mhm."
15.Orange.25	04:33.0	04:34.2	"$"
15.Blue.44	04:33.2	04:36.7	"So what is our plan of action $?"
15.Purple.61	04:37.6	04:38.3	"Well, I don't know."
15.Purple.62	04:38.3	04:44.5	"I think that if we knew that we were eighty miles northwest of small town, I th-I would probably move."
15.Yellow.30	04:41.2	04:41.6	"Yeah."
15.Orange.26	04:42.9	04:43.5	"Mhm."
15.Orange.27	04:44.5	04:45.0	"I would."
15.Purple.63	04:44.9	04:49.6	"I mean I don't have great directions but like northwest like you have a compass."
15.Orange.28	04:46.4	04:47.8	"$"
15.Yellow.31	04:47.4	04:48.2	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.32	04:48.8	04:49.3	"Yeah."
15.Orange.29	04:49.1	04:51.6	"I'd rather move than freeze $."
15.Purple.64	04:49.6	04:50.8	"So, you know where you are."
15.Yellow.33	04:50.4	04:56.4	"Exactly, yeah if you have -- if you have a steady pace, you could probably easily do the twenty thirty miles a day towards the town."
15.Purple.65	04:51.3	04:52.4	"You know what I mean?"
15.Purple.66	04:55.1	04:55.8	"Exactly."
15.Blue.45	04:57.1	05:01.7	"So, now that we are moving first, do we want to put compass or should we put --"
15.Purple.67	04:59.5	05:01.5	"So-w-s-should we say compass?"
15.Orange.30	05:01.1	05:02.3	"Should we put compass?"
15.Yellow.34	05:01.8	05:02.4	"Yeah."
15.Purple.68	05:02.4	05:02.8	"Okay."
15.Orange.31	05:02.9	05:03.5	"Number one."
15.Yellow.35	05:03.3	05:08.6	"Cause then it says there's rivers and th-stuf too, so if you have to side track around, you have to still know your direction."
15.Purple.69	05:06.0	05:06.7	"Exactly."
15.Purple.70	05:08.1	05:08.6	"Yeah."
15.Blue.46	05:08.6	05:09.0	"Mhm."
15.Purple.71	05:09.0	05:09.7	"Exactly."
15.Blue.47	05:09.7	05:10.7	"It says that --"
15.Purple.72	05:09.7	05:11.8	"And also because there is rivers."
15.Purple.73	05:11.8	05:17.6	"Usually if you follow a river, it will bring you like somewhere close to town."
15.Blue.48	05:15.5	05:16.7	"Somewhere around there."
15.Blue.49	05:16.7	05:17.2	"Mhm."
15.Blue.50	05:17.6	05:18.1	"Mhm."
15.Purple.74	05:17.6	05:18.1	"You know what I mean."
15.Orange.32	05:18.3	05:18.8	"Yeah."
15.Purple.75	05:18.7	05:21.7	"Right means you can like look like find stuff."
15.Yellow.36	05:20.7	05:21.4	"Yeah."
15.Blue.51	05:21.6	05:22.2	"Mhm."
15.Purple.76	05:21.7	05:22.4	"You know what I mean?"
15.Orange.33	05:22.6	05:23.7	"Mhm, for sure."
15.Purple.77	05:22.8	05:25.0	"So, yeah, probably compass."
15.Orange.34	05:25.4	05:26.1	"Okay."
15.Blue.52	05:26.1	05:26.7	"Sorry."
15.Purple.78	05:26.8	05:28.3	"And then what about for number two?"
15.Blue.53	05:28.8	05:31.3	"Well, I was going to say do you want to put map with?"
15.Blue.54	05:31.3	05:35.6	"Or are we, or are familiar with Manitoba $."
15.Purple.79	05:31.5	05:33.5	"That's what I was thinking about that too."
15.Yellow.37	05:32.8	05:33.4	"Uh."
15.Orange.35	05:33.9	05:35.3	"Yeah, map."
15.Yellow.38	05:35.6	05:40.3	"Uh, I just figure the map might cut down time cause you know where like I guess the ravine or the river is."
15.Blue.55	05:38.5	05:39.0	"%"
15.Yellow.39	05:40.3	05:44.5	"So you could bypass it instead of just approaching it, like oh I have to go a different route."
15.Orange.36	05:41.2	05:41.7	"Mhm."
15.Blue.56	05:41.7	05:42.1	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.40	05:44.6	05:47.8	"But the same time, the compass is still sort of helping you know your directions."
15.Blue.57	05:47.7	05:48.2	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.41	05:47.8	05:51.1	"So, I don't think the map is as important as the compass."
15.Orange.37	05:51.3	05:51.7	"Mhm."
15.Blue.58	05:51.8	05:52.4	"Okay."
15.Blue.59	05:53.1	05:55.5	"Are we worried about safety $ like?"
15.Purple.80	05:55.2	05:57.4	"That's what I was thinking too like what happens if --"
15.Yellow.42	05:56.1	05:57.2	"Manitoba [unclear]."

15.Purple.83	06:10.7	06:13.2	"I feel like I would still put knife as number two."
15.Blue.62	06:13.3	06:13.9	"Okay."
15.Purple.84	06:14.3	06:18.2	"But I don't know if you guys agree $."
15.Blue.63	06:19.2	06:24.8	"Well I mean that can be a safety item but also if you need to stop, then you know, you can start."
15.Purple.85	06:22.3	06:24.5	"Right like it is practical."
15.Yellow.46	06:24.1	06:29.8	"I think of long term too cause you don't know how long you're going to be there for and you don't know how long it's going to take you to get eighty miles."
15.Purple.86	06:27.2	06:28.2	"Exactly."
15.Purple.87	06:29.5	06:30.0	"Mhm."

15.Orange.42	06:29.9	06:30.5	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.48	06:32.9	06:35.0	"Someone might get injured."
15.Yellow.49	06:35.0	06:38.5	"So many variables in this kind of a scenario."
15.Purple.88	06:38.2	06:38.7	"Yeah."
15.Orange.43	06:38.7	06:39.1	"Yeah."
15.Blue.64	06:38.9	06:39.3	"Mhm."
15.Orange.44	06:39.9	06:43.5	"But, I think like knife would probably be like a good choice for like protection."
15.Blue.65	06:41.8	06:44.5	"Eighty miles isn't that far if you think about it."
15.Blue.66	06:46.6	06:49.6	"So, can we run for ten miles [unclear]."
15.Purple.89	06:48.2	06:48.7	"Yeah."
15.Blue.67	06:49.6	06:50.5	"That's only an hour."
15.Blue.68	06:50.6	06:51.0	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.50	06:51.6	06:54.2	"I could probably clear eighty miles in a day."
15.Blue.69	06:54.3	06:54.9	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.51	06:54.8	06:57.5	"You really could if you really wanted to then yeah."
15.Blue.70	06:55.1	06:58.4	"If you really work for it $."
15.Blue.71	06:58.6	07:01.5	"Okay, so sorry [unclear]."
15.Purple.90	07:00.1	07:02.3	"Okay, so what are we doing for number two?"
15.Orange.45	07:02.6	07:03.6	"Oh boy."
15.Orange.46	07:04.6	07:06.8	"We don't think we're going to be out there until like late."
15.Orange.47	07:06.8	07:15.1	"So m-maybe we'll put like all of like the the flashlight with batteries and cigarette lighter closer to like less important things."
15.Yellow.52	07:11.3	07:11.9	"Hm."
15.Blue.72	07:11.6	07:12.1	"Mhm."
15.Purple.91	07:12.0	07:12.5	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.53	07:13.7	07:16.6	"Yeah u-yeah, well usually you're not travelling in the darkness."
15.Yellow.54	07:16.6	07:17.8	"It's usually unsafe to do that."
15.Orange.48	07:16.9	07:17.7	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.55	07:17.8	07:20.8	"So I don't think there's like much use for a flashlight for staying."
15.Orange.49	07:18.9	07:22.2	"Yeah so, w-we'll narrow these things out until like the later."
15.Purple.92	07:20.6	07:21.1	"Mhm."
15.Blue.73	07:22.1	07:22.6	"Mhm."
15.Orange.50	07:23.5	07:24.3	"Um."
15.Purple.93	07:24.6	07:34.1	"So, would we use the knife to help build shelter then because now that we're moving, we don't have the frame of the plane for shelter and."
15.Blue.74	07:32.5	07:33.0	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.56	07:34.1	07:34.7	"Yeah."
15.Purple.94	07:35.4	07:36.8	"So, you know what I mean."

15.Purple.95	07:36.8	07:38.1	"Like cut down I guess."

15.Blue.76	07:39.7	07:42.5	"[unclear]"
15.Purple.96	07:39.8	07:41.7	"Yeah, make sure you have the knife."
15.Purple.97	07:41.7	07:42.5	"That makes sense."
15.Blue.77	07:42.5	07:43.6	"You will be warm."
15.Purple.98	07:43.2	07:44.4	"Yeah, exactly."
15.Blue.78	07:43.6	07:46.4	"And then if you have a shelter, you can use those like."
15.Purple.99	07:45.9	07:46.6	"Exactly."
15.Yellow.58	07:46.6	07:49.3	"And then it can help make a fire too, so then."
15.Orange.51	07:48.9	07:51.1	"So, we can all agree on number two for knife?"
15.Blue.79	07:50.2	07:50.9	"Mhm."
15.Purple.100	07:50.2	07:50.6	"Yeah."

15.Orange.52	07:55.5	07:57.3	"Um, I had food for my number three."

15.Yellow.62	07:59.3	08:03.3	"But I mean a ch-a chocolate bar with a can of shortening like."

15.Purple.107	08:07.3	08:09.2	"Useful [unclear]."
15.Blue.80	08:09.9	08:12.7	"Um, it takes longer to burn through fat, so."

15.Yellow.66	08:16.8	08:17.2	"Yeah."
15.Blue.82	08:16.9	08:22.3	"Right cause the carbs are just going to make you want more, whereas as much as the other one tastes bad, it's going to last for longer. "

15.Yellow.68	08:30.3	08:38.5	"So I mean I don't think it is going to take realistically eighty miles depending on the terrain, I don't think it's going to take more than a week to get there."
15.Orange.58	08:30.9	08:31.5	"Mhm."
15.Orange.59	08:34.8	08:35.2	"Yeah."

15.Purple.118	08:53.9	08:54.4	"Yeah."

15.Orange.68	09:18.9	09:19.3	"Yeah."

15.Blue.90	09:22.8	09:30.3	"What if... what if since since we're having so much trouble, do we want to work backwards and everyone just say what their last, their bottom two are."

15.Blue.92	09:36.7	09:37.4	"Okay."
15.Orange.71	09:37.3	09:41.1	"Mine was the whiskey and the caliber pistol."

15.Yellow.89	11:21.4	11:24.6	"Twelve, uh, th-I did the flashlight with batteries."
15.Purple.147	11:24.8	11:27.0	"Okay, well what about the air map?"
15.Purple.148	11:27.0	11:28.5	"We said that we weren't really using that."
15.Purple.149	11:28.5	11:29.8	"So why don't we put that near the bottom?"
15.Yellow.90	11:28.6	11:29.3	"Yeah."
15.Blue.116	11:29.5	11:30.9	"Yeah, that as well."
15.Yellow.91	11:30.3	11:30.8	"Yeah."
15.Purple.150	11:31.3	11:32.2	"And then."
15.Purple.151	11:33.7	11:34.6	"The flashlight. "
15.Purple.152	11:34.6	11:35.5	"Yeah I don't know."
15.Yellow.92	11:36.1	11:37.1	"Uh, I mean."
15.Purple.153	11:37.0	11:37.6	"I mean."
15.Blue.117	11:37.1	11:38.6	"I mean we can even light something."
15.Blue.118	11:38.6	11:44.0	"If we have like you know like a bundle you know you bundle wood or whatever and you just carry it as a torch versus having the flashlight."
15.Purple.154	11:43.1	11:45.2	"Yeah I think that is useful."
15.Yellow.93	11:44.1	11:44.7	"Yeah."
15.Blue.119	11:44.8	11:46.6	"And as long as you keep that going."
15.Yellow.94	11:45.4	11:47.4	"Wrap some clothes, use the whiskey."
15.Purple.155	11:46.6	11:47.5	"Yeah, yeah."
15.Blue.120	11:47.5	11:48.7	"There ya go $."
15.Purple.156	11:48.8	11:50.2	"Um, yeah."
15.Blue.121	11:49.8	11:53.1	"So, um flashlight with batteries near the bottom as well."
15.Orange.88	11:50.9	11:51.5	"So."
15.Orange.89	11:52.5	11:53.2	"Mhm."
15.Purple.157	11:53.2	11:54.9	"Did you -- did we already do the chocolate?"
15.Orange.90	11:55.2	11:56.7	"Um, no."
15.Orange.91	11:56.7	12:00.6	"Should we do the chocolate bar as the-the chocolate bar and the shortening as ten and --"
15.Yellow.95	11:57.7	11:58.4	"Sure."
15.Purple.158	11:58.8	11:59.6	"I don't know."
15.Purple.159	11:59.6	12:01.5	"I feel like that's not useful at all."
15.Orange.92	12:01.1	12:01.7	"Ten and nine."
15.Purple.160	12:01.9	12:02.8	"To be honest."
15.Purple.161	12:02.8	12:04.1	"Like what are you going to do with chocolate?"
15.Purple.162	12:04.1	12:05.1	"Like it doesn't fill you up."
15.Purple.163	12:05.1	12:07.2	"Like I hate chewing chocolate bars."
15.Blue.122	12:05.2	12:08.0	"Well [unclear] you could ration it."
15.Orange.93	12:06.9	12:07.4	"Yeah."
15.Purple.164	12:07.8	12:08.6	"That's true."
15.Orange.94	12:08.1	12:08.7	"Mhm."
15.Blue.123	12:08.5	12:10.1	"Cause you're going to get hungry at some point."
15.Blue.124	12:10.1	12:11.6	"Like cause you are not going to get there in one day."
15.Blue.125	12:11.6	12:12.8	"But, yeah so."
15.Purple.165	12:11.6	12:13.6	"Yeah, but all it is is sugar."
15.Yellow.96	12:12.9	12:13.4	"Yeah."
15.Purple.166	12:13.6	12:17.3	"Like what is s-sugar's just gonna -- sugar makes you hyper and it crashes you."
15.Orange.95	12:14.0	12:16.6	"Personally I think sugar would make you tired."
15.Orange.96	12:17.0	12:17.4	"Yeah."
15.Purple.167	12:17.3	12:19.1	"So you're gonna be more tired after it."
15.Purple.168	12:19.2	12:20.1	"You know what I mean?"
15.Blue.126	12:19.6	12:20.5	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.97	12:20.0	12:21.9	"I don't think really I had used it too much."
15.Purple.169	12:20.5	12:21.5	"I don't know."
15.Orange.97	12:21.7	12:23.0	"$"
15.Yellow.98	12:22.4	12:24.1	"I mean if you were to carry it."
15.Blue.127	12:23.3	12:27.8	"We only have five minutes so [unclear] $."
15.Orange.98	12:24.1	12:25.2	"$"
15.Purple.170	12:25.4	12:26.8	"$"
15.Yellow.99	12:26.3	12:28.5	"Chocolate, you're going low on the list, okay."
15.Orange.99	12:27.9	12:30.0	"Okay, I write that as number eight."
15.Blue.128	12:28.6	12:29.4	"Yeah, that is fine."
15.Purple.171	12:29.6	12:30.3	"$"
15.Yellow.100	12:30.0	12:32.0	"Okay, so we are at number eight."
15.Purple.172	12:32.0	12:32.3	"Yeah."
15.Yellow.101	12:32.1	12:34.9	"Uh, I did thirty feet of rope as numb-my number eight."
15.Blue.129	12:35.8	12:36.4	"Uh."
15.Orange.100	12:36.4	12:37.9	"Um I did my compress kit."
15.Orange.101	12:37.9	12:39.8	"But my number nine was the thirty feet of rope."
15.Blue.130	12:39.8	12:43.1	"Can you just actually read out what we have left that's open [unclear]?"
15.Purple.173	12:41.3	12:41.9	"Yeah."
15.Orange.102	12:42.2	12:52.0	"Yeah, we have the cigarette lighter without fluid, newspaper, uh, whiskey, uh, loaded caliber gun, thirty feet of rope, and the extra shirt and pants."
15.Purple.174	12:42.7	12:43.2	"Yeah."
15.Blue.131	12:43.1	12:43.1	"Mhm."
15.Blue.132	12:44.3	12:44.8	"Mhm."
15.Blue.133	12:47.3	12:47.8	"Yeah."
15.Blue.134	12:52.6	12:58.7	"Okay, so why don't we like rank for kind of maybe instead of what we have just off of like what we have left?"
15.Purple.175	12:52.6	12:53.0	"Mhm."
15.Purple.176	13:00.2	13:00.7	"Um."
15.Blue.135	13:00.7	13:01.9	"What do we think about the gun?"
15.Blue.136	13:02.1	13:03.8	"Like lower or higher?"
15.Yellow.102	13:02.1	13:05.4	"Uh, the gun could come in handy if you come across an animal."
15.Purple.177	13:03.5	13:10.3	"I think yo-I also think it could come in handy if you get close enough to town and we shoot it. "
15.Purple.178	13:10.3	13:11.5	"Then people might hear."
15.Blue.137	13:11.7	13:13.3	"Okay, very good point, yeah."
15.Purple.179	13:12.1	13:13.2	"Do you know what I mean?"
15.Blue.138	13:13.3	13:14.6	"Maybe rank that higher."
15.Purple.180	13:13.6	13:18.5	"Like he asked for protection as well but also just for the sound of it like it is kind of like flare right."
15.Blue.139	13:15.3	13:15.7	"Mhm."
15.Yellow.103	13:15.3	13:15.8	"Yeah."
15.Blue.140	13:17.4	13:17.9	"Mhm."
15.Purple.181	13:18.5	13:20.4	"When you hear a gun shot, you don't ignore it."
15.Blue.141	13:20.2	13:20.7	"Very true."
15.Purple.182	13:20.5	13:23.5	"Right like someone goes and investigate to see what is going on, so."
15.Blue.142	13:22.6	13:23.3	"Mhm."
15.Orange.103	13:23.7	13:25.7	"So, that one would be like more important."
15.Purple.183	13:24.3	13:27.4	"I feel it would be like probably our next one."
15.Blue.143	13:25.7	13:26.1	"Yeah."
15.Blue.144	13:27.4	13:27.8	"Yeah."
15.Purple.184	13:27.8	13:28.6	"I would say."
15.Blue.145	13:29.7	13:31.7	"And then we have pants and clothes."
15.Blue.146	13:31.7	13:33.4	"Do we want to rank that lower or higher?"
15.Yellow.104	13:33.1	13:33.5	"Higher."
15.Purple.185	13:33.3	13:35.3	"Higher, I think it should be our next one."
15.Blue.147	13:34.6	13:35.0	"Okay. "
15.Blue.148	13:35.3	13:35.8	"Okay."
15.Orange.104	13:36.1	13:37.1	"Number seven."
15.Purple.186	13:37.1	13:37.4	"Yeah."
15.Orange.105	13:37.4	13:37.8	"Yeah."
15.Blue.149	13:37.5	13:38.0	"Sure."
15.Blue.150	13:38.6	13:40.6	"Um, uh uh uh."
15.Orange.106	13:40.0	13:45.0	"I don't really think the eighty-five proof whiskey is all that -- "
15.Purple.187	13:43.5	13:45.1	"Is whiskey flammable?"
15.Yellow.105	13:45.2	13:45.6	"Yeah."
15.Blue.151	13:45.6	13:46.1	"Yeah."
15.Purple.188	13:46.1	13:49.3	"Okay, so then that would be good with the cigarette lighter."
15.Yellow.106	13:47.9	13:50.2	"Also, it is disinfectant too."
15.Blue.152	13:49.1	13:52.6	"So, put the rope at the most bottom."
15.Purple.189	13:52.1	13:57.6	"Yeah, put the rope th-the least number we have left, so... ch-ch-ch-ch-ch."
15.Blue.153	13:54.3	13:58.9	"Yeah, and then keep the lighter and newspaper at [unclear] clumped together."
15.Purple.190	13:57.6	13:58.0	"Ten?"
15.Purple.191	13:58.5	14:00.8	"No, we have ten, nine, what?"
15.Blue.154	14:01.4	14:04.1	"Uh, eight, oh, so."
15.Orange.107	14:03.3	14:05.7	"I have been ranking backwards."
15.Blue.155	14:04.5	14:06.7	"Do we have fourteen, thirteen?"
15.Purple.192	14:06.3	14:07.7	"Yeah, we have fourteen."
15.Blue.156	14:06.7	14:07.9	"Yeah, we have twelve."
15.Orange.108	14:08.2	14:11.5	"Yeah cause one is ranked most important, fifteenth's ranked the least important."
15.Blue.157	14:08.3	14:10.0	"Okay [unclear]."
15.Blue.158	14:11.4	14:12.3	"Yeah, that's fine."
15.Blue.159	14:12.9	14:16.0	"Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, uh."
15.Purple.193	14:15.4	14:17.4	"Oh okay, so make that eight then."
15.Blue.160	14:17.4	14:18.1	"Seven."
15.Orange.109	14:17.8	14:18.3	"Okay."
15.Purple.194	14:18.3	14:19.5	"And then that."
15.Purple.195	14:20.1	14:20.7	"Six."
15.Blue.161	14:21.0	14:21.5	"Yeah."
15.Purple.196	14:21.6	14:22.1	"Yeah."
15.Blue.162	14:21.7	14:22.7	"Do you think we can swap them $."
15.Purple.197	14:22.8	14:23.1	"Right."
15.Orange.110	14:23.0	14:23.4	"Okay."
15.Purple.198	14:23.1	14:24.5	"Okay cause that's the least."
15.Orange.111	14:23.4	14:25.8	"So you're saying that this one is six and that one is --"
15.Purple.199	14:24.9	14:26.1	"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
15.Yellow.107	14:26.2	14:27.6	"What do we have left?"
15.Purple.200	14:27.5	14:31.7	"We have cigarette lighter, newspaper, and whiskey."
15.Blue.163	14:27.8	14:28.7	"Um."
15.Blue.164	14:30.2	14:31.5	"And whiskey."
15.Yellow.108	14:31.7	14:35.0	"Uh, all three of those can be used for starting a fire."
15.Purple.201	14:34.6	14:35.4	"Exactly."
15.Yellow.109	14:35.0	14:36.7	"So order doesn't really matter too much."
15.Yellow.110	14:36.7	14:41.4	"I think maybe the cigarette lighter would be the most important because you can use any can kind of tinder to spark it."
15.Purple.202	14:40.6	14:41.6	"I agree."
15.Blue.165	14:41.5	14:42.0	"Uhuh."
15.Yellow.111	14:42.2	14:44.2	"Whereas it's hard to start make sparks and."
15.Purple.203	14:42.5	14:45.8	"It is really hard to make that yourself."
15.Yellow.112	14:45.4	14:45.9	"Yeah."
15.Purple.204	14:45.8	14:48.3	"Especially when you're cold and hungry and."
15.Blue.166	14:47.4	14:50.9	"We've already written down two so [unclear] for three?"
15.Orange.112	14:49.0	14:50.6	"You mean three for three?"
15.Blue.167	14:51.3	14:51.8	"Yeah."
15.Purple.205	14:51.5	14:52.6	"So, that."
15.Orange.113	14:51.7	14:53.3	"[unclear] three."
15.Blue.168	14:52.9	14:56.5	"And then do you think newspaper or alcohol is above [unclear]."
15.Purple.206	14:53.0	14:53.5	"Three."
15.Purple.207	14:56.5	15:00.3	"Uh, what would be more flammable if you were to use the cigarette lighter as, uh."
15.Purple.208	15:01.1	15:02.9	"Oh wait, there's no fluid."
15.Blue.169	15:01.4	15:02.4	"I don't know."
15.Blue.170	15:02.6	15:04.7	"Actually, no no no, wait, you would --"
15.Purple.209	15:03.9	15:06.9	"You would get a spark but that's that's about it, yeah."
15.Blue.171	15:06.1	15:08.8	"Well you think of s-newspaper, it has a dual purpose."
15.Blue.172	15:08.8	15:11.0	"Cause you can like also insulate your boots that way."
15.Orange.114	15:11.1	15:13.9	"Yeah it did say bring one per person [unclear]."
15.Purple.210	15:11.1	15:12.4	"Yeah that's true."
15.Blue.173	15:12.1	15:13.5	"But also one per person."
15.Blue.174	15:13.5	15:16.3	"If you think of how many sheets there are, you can increase the surface area."
15.Yellow.113	15:15.2	15:15.8	"Yeah."
15.Blue.175	15:16.3	15:17.9	"You don't need that much to start a fire."
15.Purple.211	15:16.7	15:17.6	"Hm."
15.Blue.176	15:18.3	15:18.9	"So."
15.Blue.177	15:19.4	15:22.8	"Cause I mean like that's gonna be a lot lighter than carrying eighty-five proof --"
15.Yellow.114	15:19.4	15:20.0	"Are we --"
15.Blue.178	15:22.8	15:25.7	"Well actually I don't know how big a [unclear] quart, but."
15.Purple.212	15:23.1	15:23.7	"Yeah."
15.Orange.115	15:26.2	15:29.5	"So put new-newspaper as like four, whiskey five?"
15.Blue.179	15:28.5	15:28.9	"Sure."
15.Yellow.115	15:28.9	15:32.8	"A quart's like the size of a like a like oil, like a small oil."
15.Purple.213	15:29.1	15:30.4	"I think so."
15.Purple.214	15:31.5	15:33.1	"Yeah I think that's --"
15.Blue.180	15:32.1	15:34.8	"Oh okay $ thanks, I was like [unclear]."
15.Purple.215	15:33.4	15:34.8	"So if it's not -- "
