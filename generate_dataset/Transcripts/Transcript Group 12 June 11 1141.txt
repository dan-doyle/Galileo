12.Pink.12	01:11.2	01:13.1	"The compass or the flashlight?"
12.Blue.9	01:13.0	01:14.2	"I think compass first."
12.Orange.10	01:14.1	01:15.4	"Probably compass, yeah."
12.Blue.10	01:14.6	01:17.6	"Cause they can travel during the day with the compass."
12.Blue.11	01:17.6	01:19.9	"If they didn't have a flashlight they can just rest."
12.Pink.13	01:19.6	01:20.2	"Yeah."
