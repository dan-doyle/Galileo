14.Red.1	00:00.2	00:07.5	"Okay, so the first thing we would have to decide is whether or not we want to start walking to the nearest town or stay near the crash sight."
14.Red.2	00:07.7	00:11.7	"It says that the frame of the plane is still intact."
14.Red.3	00:11.7	00:15.7	"And it says that it's going to be negative twenty-five during the day and minus forty at night."
14.Red.4	00:16.1	00:28.6	"It's eighty miles through brush and trees separated by lakes and rivers which is, I don't know if you guys have hiked before, it's very hard to go through, especially hiking to a town where you don't know where the town is."
14.Red.5	00:29.3	00:37.5	"So, my suggestion would be stay near the crash sight until, uh, possible comes-comes for help or until you run out of the food."
14.Red.6	00:37.9	00:48.9	"Um, being that the -- being that the temperature is % is low as it is, uh, I think the frame would provide a good shelter."
14.Red.7	00:49.1	01:00.9	"Um, so I think the most important thing of all these items being that the temperature and what we're in, no matter what we decide what we want to do, that the extra pants and shirt for survival is crucial."
14.Blue.1	01:00.9	01:02.6	"I put that too for number one."
14.Red.8	01:02.9	01:04.3	"What did you guys put for number one?"
14.Yellow.1	01:04.4	01:08.0	"I put the compress kit cause if-what if someone's injured and then like --"
14.Red.9	01:07.9	01:13.3	"That's the ques-that's a question too because it wasn't in -- there was in-in the in all the writing they didn't say that anyone was injured."
14.Yellow.2	01:10.3	01:10.8	"Oh."
14.Red.10	01:13.3	01:16.6	"So, it would be kind of thing whether somebody would get injured."
14.Yellow.3	01:14.5	01:15.7	"[unclear]"
14.Blue.2	01:16.7	01:18.0	"What is the compress kit?"
14.Red.11	01:18.1	01:22.1	"It's like, uh, gauze and, uh, bandages and stuff like that."
14.Blue.3	01:21.3	01:22.7	"Oh okay, like a first aid."
14.Red.12	01:22.7	01:24.1	"Yeah, like a small first aid kit."
14.Red.13	01:25.9	01:27.2	"Um, I guess --"
14.Blue.4	01:26.7	01:30.7	"So, I feel like warmth and food are the most important things in this situation."
14.Red.14	01:30.7	01:34.0	"That's what I think cause either way you're walking or whether you're staying, you need warmth and food."
14.Blue.5	01:31.3	01:31.8	"So."
14.Blue.6	01:33.0	01:33.4	"Yeah."
14.Blue.7	01:33.7	01:34.2	"Yeah."
14.Blue.8	01:34.4	01:39.6	"So, like I put shirts and pants for first and then the chocolate bar for second cause it was the only food we have."
14.Red.15	01:37.1	01:37.8	"%"
14.Yellow.4	01:38.2	01:39.2	"Hm, mhm."
14.Red.16	01:40.1	01:43.1	"Well, that's where you could, uh, put into a discussion."
14.Red.17	01:43.1	01:46.1	"Is the chocolate bar is the most important food you have."
14.Red.18	01:46.1	01:48.5	"But you also have a loaded gun."
14.Yellow.5	01:48.3	01:48.8	"Yeah."
14.Red.19	01:48.6	01:57.2	"And if you're able to make fire and you're in the bush, there's lots of, r-uh, squirrels, rabbits, animals that are around you could kill for food."
14.Red.20	01:57.4	02:02.7	"A chocolate bar each is only gonna last us for nutritional wise, it's only gonna last us a day."
14.Yellow.6	02:02.7	02:03.5	"Yeah that's true."
14.Red.21	02:03.5	02:14.2	"So, the shortening is actually more important for food cause it's fat is better, um, for your metabolism for energy than, uh, the chocolate the-the simple sugars in the chocolate."
14.Red.22	02:14.4	02:20.7	"Um, but I guess -- I guess it comes to decision, what do you guys think we should do?"
14.Red.23	02:20.7	02:32.4	"Would you rather walk to the closest city or would you rather, um, stay near the crash site until, uh, few days have gone by to see whether or not, um, people are coming to help?"
14.Pink.1	02:33.1	02:37.3	"I was thinking of walking cause we don't know how long it could take."
14.Red.24	02:37.2	02:38.2	"Yeah."
14.Pink.2	02:37.3	02:45.9	"We could potentially run out of food and like stuff so it would be better to get closer to the town if we could."
14.Red.25	02:40.4	02:40.9	"Yeah."
14.Red.26	02:41.5	02:42.0	"Yeah."
14.Red.27	02:45.9	02:46.5	"Mhm."
14.Red.28	02:46.6	02:47.1	"And --"
14.Pink.3	02:46.8	02:48.6	"Like you don't have to make all the way."
14.Red.29	02:48.6	02:49.4	"Mhm."
14.Red.30	02:49.6	02:56.3	"Um, it does say, uh, but it does say that, um, we have a sectional air map made of plastic."
14.Pink.4	02:51.7	02:52.5	"Yeah."
14.Red.31	02:56.3	02:58.3	"Now I'm assuming that that just shows the brush."
14.Red.32	02:58.3	03:14.1	"I'm assuming which, uh, which way the city is because, uh, it says in the writing that, um, somebody had told you that the city is some uh -- pilot announced shortly before the crash that you were eighty miles northwest of a small town."
14.Red.33	03:14.1	03:16.8	"So I guess if we do -- we do know the area we got to go towards."
14.Red.34	03:16.8	03:19.4	"So, yeah walking wouldn't be the worst idea."
14.Pink.5	03:17.0	03:17.8	"Mhm."
14.Blue.9	03:19.4	03:24.6	"Yeah, and if there's a scale on the map then you can actually just measure where the town would be by yourself."
14.Pink.6	03:19.6	03:20.1	"Mhm."
14.Red.35	03:24.6	03:26.0	"Yeah, so that's -- that's a good one."
14.Red.36	03:26.0	03:38.4	"So, um... so-we-so-we base-based on, bef-before we agree on which ones go first, you guys want to go on the idea of that we'll be walking towards town?"
14.Blue.10	03:38.2	03:38.9	"Yeah."
14.Pink.7	03:38.8	03:39.3	"Mhm."
14.Red.37	03:38.8	03:39.3	"Okay."
14.Red.38	03:39.7	03:40.1	"I like that."
14.Red.39	03:40.1	03:47.3	"So, then first of most then important I'm going to say still the shirt and pants for the walk cause it's going to be cold no matter what."
14.Pink.8	03:47.9	03:48.2	"Mhm."
14.Blue.11	03:48.1	03:48.4	"Mhm."
14.Red.40	03:48.4	03:55.3	"Then, I think for bas-basing on the walk itself, and we're -- our plan is to go there, we're going to be moving fast, we're going to want to know where we're going."
14.Red.41	03:55.7	03:59.7	"So, would you say this, which one's more important, like the sectional air map or the compass?"
14.Red.42	04:00.7	04:04.8	"I think cause I mean they are both relatively important at this point."
14.Yellow.7	04:01.6	04:02.1	"Um."
14.Red.43	04:05.0	04:06.3	"Which one would you guys do?"
14.Blue.12	04:05.6	04:06.6	"I think it's the map."
14.Blue.13	04:06.6	04:12.1	"Because with the compass, you can just walk in the direction of it, you don't like you're not going to see, you have no idea what's ahead of you."
14.Red.44	04:12.1	04:13.7	"Yeah, the rivers or the --"
14.Blue.14	04:12.8	04:14.7	"With the map, you have some sort of clue."
14.Red.45	04:14.4	04:15.7	"I agree, I like that."
14.Red.46	04:17.4	04:20.5	"Would you guys say that the compass then is important, yeah?"
14.Yellow.8	04:19.4	04:20.2	"The next one."
14.Blue.15	04:20.5	04:20.8	"Yeah."
14.Pink.9	04:20.8	04:21.1	"Hm."
14.Red.47	04:22.1	04:25.4	"Okay, so now that we've dis-discussed that we're going to be walking."
14.Red.48	04:25.4	04:26.8	"We got our extra clothes."
14.Red.49	04:26.8	04:33.8	"We got to think about, um, whether food's going to be important, protection's going to be important."
14.Red.50	04:33.8	04:36.8	"Uh, for example, how are we going to get across this r-this rivers?"
14.Red.51	04:36.9	04:39.5	"That would the rope come in handy for eventually."
14.Red.52	04:39.5	04:41.9	"But, what would be more important next?"
14.Blue.16	04:42.0	04:43.5	"Definitely food I'd think."
14.Red.53	04:43.5	04:44.2	"Yeah, food."
14.Red.54	04:44.2	04:49.0	"So, I personally would say the can of shortening is probably more useful than the chocolate bars."
14.Red.55	04:49.5	04:50.9	"But, what do you guys think?"
14.Pink.10	04:51.3	04:59.7	"Yeah, I think the can of shortening is better cause you don't have to eat as much to like get like energy, yeah."
14.Red.56	04:54.5	04:55.1	"Mhm."
14.Red.57	04:59.2	04:59.6	"Yeah."
14.Red.58	05:00.4	05:01.0	"Okay, so."
14.Yellow.9	05:00.4	05:01.1	"Mhm."
14.Red.59	05:03.8	05:09.6	"And then, so moving forward from food, um, I mean the clothing is going to be nice to keep us warm."
14.Red.60	05:09.6	05:14.0	"But at the same time at night time minus forty, that's not warm enough to keep you warm."
14.Red.61	05:14.0	05:26.9	"At the fir-first night, we're going to need something to keep us warm, uh, while we're trying to sleep or while we're at night because, uh, extra shirt and pants and our winter clothes isn't k-going to be warm enough."
14.Blue.17	05:26.8	05:27.2	"Okay."
14.Red.62	05:27.2	05:32.2	"So, what do you guys think would be, um, next important?"
14.Red.63	05:32.2	05:40.7	"Would you guys say starting a fire would be next important or building a shelter or what what what would you guys suggest?"
14.Blue.18	05:40.7	05:41.6	"Probably fire."
14.Red.64	05:42.0	05:51.4	"Okay, so if you guys think uh -- personally I think that, um, the, uh, cigarette lighter without the fluid and the newspaper is the best."
14.Red.65	05:51.7	05:56.0	"Like fire options cause even though -- even though it doesn't have fluid, it still has a spark."
14.Yellow.10	05:55.9	05:56.3	"Oh."
14.Red.66	05:56.1	05:58.2	"And that's what -- that's what will start the fire."
14.Blue.19	05:56.4	05:57.1	"Oh."
14.Red.67	05:58.2	06:06.0	"Um, but we don't -- aside from the cigarette lighter, we have nothing else to start a fire with if we between besides, uh rock and roll."
14.Red.68	06:06.0	06:15.0	"And I mean I mean I know there's a ball of steel wool steel wool there, but starting a fire in wet conditions, the steel wool doesn't really help that much."
14.Red.69	06:15.2	06:21.1	"So, I think the newspaper and the the lighter fluid would be more important than the steel wool for starting the fire."
14.Pink.11	06:15.2	06:15.6	"Mhm."
14.Blue.20	06:21.1	06:21.5	"Yeah."
14.Blue.21	06:21.5	06:26.2	"And newspaper first because you might be able to start a fire, I don't know what, but you need something to start it with."
14.Red.70	06:26.3	06:31.8	"Uh, okay so six, cigarette."
14.Red.71	06:31.8	06:35.1	"So now, we've got our fire."
14.Red.72	06:35.1	06:37.4	"Um, we've got our food."
14.Red.73	06:37.4	06:38.6	"We've got our clothes."
14.Red.74	06:38.7	06:47.3	"To contin-continue down this path, um, it is eighty miles, so I don't know that is in kilometers like two hundred and something kilometers."
14.Red.75	06:48.3	06:50.9	"But that's like two three days of travel."
14.Red.76	06:50.9	06:53.3	"So what do you guys think we would need to get through the brush?"
14.Red.77	06:53.3	06:58.3	"What do you think -- flashlight's more important, rope's more important, or the knife and protection's important?"
14.Red.78	06:58.6	07:05.0	"There is four of us so it's unlikely that we'll be, um, hunted more or less."
14.Red.79	07:05.0	07:07.8	"I mean we could run into something, that's a very big possibility."
14.Red.80	07:07.8	07:14.0	"But with four people that's in the bush that's pretty that's typ-typically intimidating to even bears."
14.Red.81	07:14.1	07:20.4	"Um, what do you guys think is more important, a flashlight, or having a protection?"
14.Blue.22	07:14.1	07:14.5	"Mhm."
14.Blue.23	07:22.5	07:26.0	"Maybe the protection cause that can also be used to get food if we really need to."
14.Red.82	07:26.0	07:28.5	"Yeah, I like that, dual purpose."
14.Red.83	07:28.9	07:32.3	"So, probably the caliber pistol I assume."
14.Red.84	07:32.5	07:37.8	"Or would you guys think of knife because you could use the knife to cut wood for the-the fire I think."
14.Pink.12	07:32.6	07:33.0	"Yeah."
14.Blue.24	07:32.6	07:33.1	"Yeah."
14.Blue.25	07:37.6	07:38.3	"That's true."
14.Blue.26	07:38.3	07:41.2	"The knife has like multiple purposes more than the pistol."
14.Red.85	07:41.2	07:41.6	"Mhm."
14.Blue.27	07:42.7	07:46.8	"And you're not going to run out of bullets or whatever, yeah."
14.Red.86	07:47.5	07:50.2	"Do you guys think knife would be alright next one?"
14.Pink.13	07:50.1	07:50.7	"Yeah."
14.Yellow.11	07:50.4	07:50.8	"Hm."
14.Red.87	07:50.5	07:51.2	"Yeah."
14.Red.88	07:51.3	07:54.6	"Okay, so knife."
14.Red.89	07:55.1	08:02.0	"And do we want to put the caliber pistol ahead of flashlight with batteries because without the flashlight we can't travel from, uh?"
14.Red.90	08:02.0	08:02.7	"Uh, I can't remember."
14.Red.91	08:02.7	08:05.0	"Does anyone know if it says what time of the year this is?"
14.Blue.28	08:05.3	08:06.4	"Yeah, January."
14.Red.92	08:06.3	08:13.7	"Yeah, so in Manitoba, in January, we're gonna have sunlight from like eight in the morning to like four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon."
14.Blue.29	08:13.3	08:15.3	"Yeah, I'd say flashlight and then the pistol."
14.Red.93	08:15.7	08:18.2	"Nine, ten."
14.Red.94	08:19.2	08:27.9	"Uh, so at this point we got the whiskey, the-the gauze, and the medical kit, thirty feet of rope, wool and two poles left."
14.Red.95	08:28.2	08:35.5	"I personally think that the two ski poles are the least useful of the item there because you can make that out of sticks if we need to."
14.Blue.30	08:32.6	08:33.0	"Mhm."
14.Pink.14	08:34.8	08:35.4	"Mhm."
14.Blue.31	08:35.2	08:37.6	"Yeah and you might not even use it at all."
14.Red.96	08:37.4	08:44.8	"Yeah, so I mean it is it does sound like there would be snow but at the same time like we can make out of sticks if we need to."
14.Yellow.12	08:40.7	08:41.1	"Yeah."
14.Red.97	08:44.9	08:47.1	"Um, so I'm going to put that one right down as fifteen."
14.Red.98	08:47.1	09:05.5	"Um now, the whiskey, being I think they put the eighty-five proof for a reason, cause it does have like a medical, like you can put that on a wound [unclear] a little bit, but I would say that's just for like we're back under the assumption that we're getting hurt."
14.Red.99	09:05.5	09:12.5	"So, do you guys think that is more important than the rope that we're going to need or?"
14.Blue.32	09:11.9	09:14.6	"No I think rope would be more useful."
14.Red.100	09:14.5	09:15.4	"What do you guys think?"
14.Yellow.13	09:15.4	09:17.5	"I think the rope I agree with the rope."
14.Blue.33	09:16.8	09:17.4	"Yeah."
14.Red.101	09:17.5	09:18.4	"Okay, so."
14.Red.102	09:19.5	09:20.4	"Rope next."
14.Red.103	09:20.7	09:34.2	"Now it's between the compress kit and the whiskey which is essentially medical use or the ball of steel wool which cou-I think would be useful for starting a fire kind of thing but [unclear]."
14.Blue.34	09:33.3	09:40.7	"I'd say the compress kit probably because it's like just good to have basic injury stuff."
14.Red.104	09:39.3	09:39.7	"Yeah."
14.Red.105	09:40.5	09:41.3	"I like that."
14.Red.106	09:41.3	09:41.8	"Okay."
14.Red.107	09:42.6	09:48.9	"So then, now we got just -- we just got to decide between whether the whiskey or the, uh, steel wool."
14.Red.108	09:48.9	09:49.9	"What do you guys want to put?"
14.Red.109	09:49.9	09:55.6	"Can anyone think of any purpose of steel wool would have besides starting fire kind of a thing."
14.Pink.15	09:57.5	09:58.1	"Hm."
14.Red.110	09:57.8	10:01.3	"I can't really think of -- I can't think of much that it would come handy for."
14.Red.111	10:01.3	10:04.8	"Um, so maybe we'll do that one as fourteenth."
14.Blue.35	10:01.6	10:02.2	"Um."
14.Red.112	10:05.5	10:08.7	"And that leaves quart of whiskey and we're done."
