11.Pink.1	00:02.1	00:02.9	"Okay."
11.Pink.2	00:03.1	00:08.1	"So do you want to see first maybe the similarities we have if we do have any?"
11.Green.1	00:07.4	00:08.3	"Yeah."
11.Pink.3	00:08.2	00:09.3	"Um."
11.Green.2	00:10.1	00:12.0	"I don't think so."
11.Pink.4	00:12.0	00:14.0	"Oh, family sized chocolate bar."
11.Green.3	00:13.0	00:14.0	"Yeah."
11.Pink.5	00:14.0	00:19.7	"Um, so that one I think we can maybe say for sure number three?"
11.Green.4	00:19.7	00:33.6	"Um, maybe we can start like for example like a -- okay I'm just -- um, if-if there is something we both think is more important than family sized chocolate bar we can [unclear]."
11.Pink.6	00:32.5	00:35.7	"Oh, oh, I see, so do you want to like start just like in order?"
11.Green.5	00:33.6	00:34.2	"Yeah."
11.Green.6	00:35.0	00:35.6	"Yeah."
11.Pink.7	00:35.7	00:36.8	"Yeah sure, okay."
11.Green.7	00:35.8	00:36.4	"Yeah."
11.Pink.8	00:36.8	00:38.7	"So starting at one?"
11.Green.8	00:38.1	00:38.9	"Okay."
11.Pink.9	00:38.7	00:39.2	"Okay."
11.Green.9	00:39.3	00:40.2	"So."
11.Pink.10	00:39.8	00:49.3	"So I said, uh, knife was very important because, um, you can use it for food and you can also use it for protection."
11.Pink.11	00:49.4	00:53.7	"And so I thought like the dual purpose of that would be very important for survival."
11.Green.10	00:53.6	00:54.3	"Mhm."
11.Pink.12	00:54.1	00:54.9	"Um."
11.Green.11	00:55.1	01:05.7	"I got compass because for where we need to know direction as the pilots ha-had already mentioned that this is the direction we need to start moving to so."
11.Pink.13	01:05.6	01:13.6	"So you're just planning on like heading that direction as fast as possible to limit the amount of time you're out in the winter conditions?"
11.Green.12	01:07.3	01:08.2	"Yeah."
11.Green.13	01:10.1	01:10.7	"Yeah."
11.Green.14	01:12.0	01:12.7	"Yeah."
11.Pink.14	01:13.6	01:14.1	"Okay."
11.Green.15	01:13.6	01:14.2	"Um."
11.Green.16	01:14.3	01:18.9	"Knife can, uh, come, uh, come in-come handy in a-in a later position."
11.Pink.15	01:18.5	01:25.3	"In like -- in like more of a like situation where you're like maybe at risk?"
11.Green.17	01:24.0	01:25.8	"It's a sit -- yeah."
11.Pink.16	01:25.5	01:27.7	"Yeah, okay, I can see that so."
11.Green.18	01:27.6	01:29.6	"Put down compass?"
11.Pink.17	01:28.8	01:30.9	"Compass, um."
11.Green.19	01:31.7	01:33.1	"Or the map?"
11.Pink.18	01:32.4	01:35.8	"Um, but, hm."
11.Pink.19	01:36.0	01:41.4	"Okay let's skip over that one cause ours is like very like far like a difference there maybe."
11.Green.20	01:37.3	01:38.6	"Okay."
11.Pink.20	01:41.5	01:47.0	"Um, what did you get maybe for like -- how about like food like the can of shortening?"
11.Green.21	01:41.8	01:42.3	"Hm."
11.Pink.21	01:47.6	01:49.7	"Like this -- this guy."
11.Green.22	01:48.9	01:50.4	"Um."
11.Pink.22	01:50.1	02:00.7	"That one I said too because it could be, um, when you're like out in survival it's really important to not -- cause like I think the most common thing to die of is actually starvation."
11.Green.23	01:55.5	01:56.7	"Yeah."
11.Green.24	02:00.5	02:01.6	"Yeah."
11.Pink.23	02:01.4	02:11.1	"So I was like -- so I rated, um, a lot of like the things that can be, um, eaten like very high on the list."
11.Green.25	02:11.0	02:19.3	"So-my whole purpose of, uh, keeping compass on first and air map on second was --"
11.Pink.24	02:18.4	02:20.2	"I see, we had like different point of views $."
11.Green.26	02:20.1	02:21.2	"Yeah."
11.Pink.25	02:20.2	02:23.3	"I was like I'm going to be out for a long time."
11.Green.27	02:22.0	02:23.3	"[unclear]"
11.Green.28	02:23.3	02:26.5	"Um, how much time, uh --"
11.Pink.26	02:23.3	02:24.9	"And you're like I'm getting out of here."
11.Green.29	02:27.8	02:29.6	"Does it say here, no?"
11.Pink.27	02:29.1	02:31.9	"Yeah I think -- I think we can, um."
11.Green.30	02:31.9	02:33.9	"It's eighty miles, right?"
11.Pink.28	02:32.8	02:34.0	"What do you think?"
11.Pink.29	02:34.0	02:37.5	"So you think compass is like the most important out of everything?"
11.Green.31	02:37.4	02:47.0	"No - like for me, if you can travel eighty miles in the right direction and like food and everything can be deprived of until the food so."
11.Pink.30	02:38.1	02:38.9	"Like number one?"
11.Pink.31	02:44.0	02:44.8	"Okay."
11.Pink.32	02:46.8	02:47.5	"Sure."
11.Pink.33	02:47.6	02:48.5	"Um."
11.Green.32	02:49.0	02:55.5	"Because eighty miles in the right direction means you will have, uh, a lot of -- so many chances of surviving."
11.Pink.34	02:54.9	03:01.2	"Right, you'll have like -- you -- it's less chance of like other things happening to you because you will be moving quicker?"
11.Green.33	02:58.9	03:00.3	"Yeah."
11.Green.34	03:01.0	03:03.5	"In quick -- in the -- in the right direction, yeah."
11.Pink.35	03:01.7	03:04.4	"Sure, sure, we can -- yeah let's do that."
11.Pink.36	03:04.4	03:06.6	"Okay so one is compass."
11.Pink.37	03:06.6	03:13.2	"Okay, so two I think like would h-have -- I think would need to be like a food item."
11.Green.35	03:13.3	03:14.1	"Okay."
11.Pink.38	03:13.4	03:14.5	"So maybe --"
11.Green.36	03:16.0	03:22.4	"Family sized chocolate bar because I don't think anybody wants a can of shortening as their first priority to eat."
11.Pink.39	03:18.0	03:19.2	"Sure."
11.Pink.40	03:21.2	03:25.4	"$ Sure, sure, okay, so yeah, I think that."
11.Pink.41	03:25.8	03:33.0	"And, um, for me, I was thinking yeah for my second and third was like the food."
11.Pink.42	03:33.1	03:39.8	"For my fourth was, um, the loaded forty-five, um, caliber pistol."
11.Green.37	03:40.6	03:42.1	"Okay."
11.Pink.43	03:42.2	03:44.3	"But yet again it's just because we're thinking differently."
11.Pink.44	03:44.3	03:50.4	"I was thinking about like more like defence and like survival off of like a very very like long time."
11.Green.38	03:50.1	03:54.8	"My approach is that we, uh, go into the ri-right direction."
11.Green.39	03:54.8	03:58.9	"So I got flashlight and batteries so if it's dark and --"
11.Pink.45	03:57.6	04:01.3	"Like during -- so you can still move during the night?"
11.Green.40	03:59.5	04:00.4	"Yeah."
11.Green.41	04:01.3	04:02.3	"Yeah so."
11.Green.42	04:02.3	04:06.9	"Okay so your approach is that you want to survive and I'll --"
11.Pink.46	04:05.5	04:13.2	"Yeah I'm just like bulk yourself up with like a lot of fat and a lot of like, you know, like have food available."
11.Pink.47	04:13.2	04:20.3	"And then I think like another thing I was thinking was like you don't want to like die of hypothermia so you don't want to freeze to death."
11.Green.43	04:19.4	04:20.6	"Okay."
11.Pink.48	04:20.3	04:26.9	"So I thought like having an extra shirt and like pants was like very important for each survivor."
11.Green.44	04:27.3	04:28.2	"Oh okay."
11.Pink.49	04:28.1	04:41.7	"But, um, okay so for number three, do you think it could be um -- so do you want to have the sectional air map made of plastic?"
11.Green.45	04:34.4	04:35.4	"Sure."
11.Green.46	04:39.1	04:41.7	"Yeah I think that's --"
11.Pink.50	04:41.7	04:44.3	"So have that three here?"
11.Green.47	04:44.3	04:45.3	"Yep."
11.Pink.51	04:45.9	04:46.8	"Okay."
11.Green.48	04:47.0	04:49.2	"Okay, my first three are gone."
11.Pink.52	04:49.2	04:55.8	"So I think, uh, for me, I think four should be like this just for heat."
11.Pink.53	04:55.8	05:00.3	"Like I feel -- because it says that it drops minus forty at night."
11.Pink.54	05:00.3	05:05.6	"So if you are travelling at night, like even if you have winter gear on."
11.Green.49	05:05.6	05:12.0	"Um, it's 11:30 when the plane crashed so it's still like seven to eight hours."
11.Pink.55	05:07.9	05:09.7	"Yeah but it's --"
11.Pink.56	05:09.9	05:14.7	"Yeah but you're going to be travelling like all night though walking like that distance."
11.Green.50	05:16.2	05:17.2	"Hm."
11.Pink.57	05:16.8	05:18.3	"Eighty miles."
11.Green.51	05:18.9	05:22.2	"How much time does it take to like walk eighty miles?"
11.Pink.58	05:22.1	05:27.3	"That would be -- that would be quite a long I think walk."
11.Green.52	05:28.2	05:31.1	"How much is eighty miles in kilometers?"
11.Pink.59	05:28.8	05:29.4	"Cause like --"
11.Pink.60	05:31.4	05:33.4	"Eighty miles in kilometers?"
11.Pink.61	05:33.4	05:41.8	"Kilometers -- like if you're driving in like a car maybe like I think it's like instead of going eighty miles it's like a hundred and twenty."
11.Pink.62	05:42.8	05:47.3	"So it's like m-like -- miles are-is much longer than kilometers."
11.Green.53	05:47.2	05:48.7	"Yeah yeah."
11.Pink.63	05:47.6	05:48.2	"Yeah."
11.Pink.64	05:48.7	06:04.0	"So I think like if it takes like eighty mile -- if you're going eighty miles per hour like in a car, and that's pretty fast, like this is gonna be taking like humans trekking through snow like it's gonna I think take them like maybe a couple of days."
11.Green.54	05:58.0	05:58.8	"Yeah."
11.Green.55	06:04.0	06:04.9	"A couple days?"
11.Green.56	06:04.9	06:05.6	"Really?"
11.Pink.65	06:05.2	06:09.4	"Yeah, that's why I was thinking like you need to have like --"
11.Green.57	06:10.6	06:11.5	"Fire?"
11.Pink.66	06:11.5	06:12.9	"Yeah so um."
11.Green.58	06:14.4	06:15.9	"We can with [unclear]."
11.Pink.67	06:15.2	06:19.5	"But do you want to do, um, maybe four flashlight?"
11.Green.59	06:20.8	06:24.7	"Um, but it's daylight at that time so I don't think."
11.Pink.68	06:21.4	06:22.0	"To see in --"
11.Pink.69	06:24.0	06:26.3	"Yeah, but this is just like importance."
11.Green.60	06:25.8	06:27.3	"Yeah okay."
11.Pink.70	06:27.1	06:27.8	"Yeah."
11.Green.61	06:27.7	06:37.8	"But what I'm thinking is, um, for example, it's 11:32 and the things that they need most for like the first eight hours and then [unclear]."
11.Pink.71	06:37.2	06:40.7	"So you're thinking more of like it's time oriented rather than --"
11.Green.62	06:39.9	06:41.2	"Yeah."
11.Pink.72	06:41.3	06:43.2	"Okay."
11.Green.63	06:41.4	06:44.5	"Because flashlight."
11.Pink.73	06:45.3	06:49.2	"Um okay."
11.Pink.74	06:49.8	06:50.7	"Hm."
11.Pink.75	06:51.1	06:52.6	"What do you think about injury though?"
11.Pink.76	06:52.6	06:56.4	"What do you think about like the compress kit?"
11.Green.64	06:57.2	07:02.4	"I th -- we can categorize stuff like what they need at day and what they need at night."
11.Green.65	07:02.4	07:06.1	"So, then we can further."
11.Pink.77	07:08.6	07:13.8	"I don't know, I'm just ranking -- cause it says rank the follow items in terms of their importance to your survival."
11.Pink.78	07:13.8	07:15.4	"So I-I think that's just like general."
11.Pink.79	07:15.4	07:17.4	"Like I'm-I'm not even thinking about like the time."
11.Pink.80	07:17.4	07:20.0	"I'm just thinking like to get through this."
11.Pink.81	07:20.3	07:20.8	"Like."
11.Green.66	07:21.1	07:27.4	"But to get through this we do need to consider time because it's light in the day when the plane crashed so."
11.Pink.82	07:30.2	07:31.3	"Okay."
11.Pink.83	07:31.8	07:40.7	"So, you're saying the flashlight doesn't need to be like up on the list it needs to be down because light will --"
11.Green.67	07:41.2	07:45.0	"Will be there for four to five hours at least."
11.Pink.84	07:43.5	07:47.7	"Okay okay um."
11.Green.68	07:49.4	07:52.6	"So we need -- uh, many of things we need at night."
11.Green.69	07:52.6	07:57.1	"For example, we need, uh, this whiskey at night to keep the body warm."
11.Green.70	07:58.2	08:00.6	"And what else?"
11.Green.71	08:01.4	08:02.8	"Flashlight at night."
11.Pink.85	08:02.8	08:07.3	"But alcohol decreases your body temperature."
11.Green.72	08:08.1	08:09.9	"I thought it increased."
11.Pink.86	08:11.4	08:13.9	"I thought it decreased it."
11.Green.73	08:13.9	08:15.4	"[unclear]"
11.Pink.87	08:14.8	08:20.2	"I don't know I-I was thinking more like, um, to do with wounds, like cleaning wounds and stuff."
11.Pink.88	08:20.2	08:23.9	"I can see that like being important in that aspect."
11.Green.74	08:23.7	08:24.4	"Um."
11.Pink.89	08:23.9	08:26.4	"Not for like drinking."
11.Green.75	08:25.4	08:26.4	"Drinking?"
11.Green.76	08:26.4	08:27.0	"Okay."
11.Pink.90	08:26.7	08:29.9	"But that's like a good point, too, um."
11.Pink.91	08:31.6	08:35.8	"Or you can just drink it when it's just like you're like I'm going to die anyway $."
11.Green.77	08:34.3	08:35.3	"$"
11.Pink.92	08:35.8	08:44.8	"Um, okay, so, um, for me, I think I would probably do, um, I think I would rate this probably five."
11.Green.78	08:43.1	08:45.2	"Oh, yeah, sure, okay."
11.Pink.93	08:44.8	08:48.4	"So it -- maybe not four because it-it doesn't have to be like that, but."
11.Pink.94	08:48.4	08:52.7	"Okay, so that five for extra shirt and pants."
11.Pink.95	08:52.9	08:56.5	"Um, what do you think would be six?"
11.Pink.96	08:56.5	09:00.5	"I think me and you had very -- like you have seven and I have six for here."
11.Green.79	08:56.6	08:57.8	"[unclear]"
11.Green.80	09:00.5	09:01.6	"Yeah okay."
11.Pink.97	09:01.5	09:03.4	"So maybe one of those?"
11.Green.81	09:03.4	09:04.1	"Sure."
11.Pink.98	09:04.1	09:05.0	"Sure okay."
11.Pink.99	09:05.4	09:08.1	"So I'm going to do six for that guy."
11.Pink.100	09:09.9	09:11.7	"Um, how about seven?"
11.Pink.101	09:11.7	09:14.1	"What did you -- oh sorry, maybe eight for you."
11.Green.82	09:11.8	09:12.5	"Um."
11.Green.83	09:14.2	09:16.8	"Um, we can go with can of short-shortening."
11.Pink.102	09:14.3	09:15.3	"Okay."
11.Green.84	09:17.1	09:25.0	"We have [unclear] because this won't um la -- give that much energy per person."
11.Pink.103	09:17.3	09:18.6	"Four."
11.Pink.104	09:25.2	09:32.0	"Okay, um, for-for thirty feet of rope, you have eight and I have seven, which are pretty close."
11.Pink.105	09:32.0	09:35.1	"So do you want to do like do you want to do eight for that then?"
11.Green.85	09:35.2	09:40.3	"Um, should we, uh, include all the things that a-above five that haven't been included?"
11.Green.86	09:40.3	09:43.4	"You have can of shortening at two."
11.Pink.106	09:43.3	09:43.6	"Mhm."
11.Green.87	09:44.0	09:45.6	"And it's pretty --"
11.Pink.107	09:45.6	09:47.3	"So do you want to do like four then?"
11.Pink.108	09:47.3	09:48.9	"Cause we're missing four still."
11.Green.88	09:48.5	09:50.0	"Yeah, we can do that."
11.Pink.109	09:49.0	09:50.3	"Okay sure."
11.Pink.110	09:52.0	09:54.4	"So, one, two, three, four, five, six."
11.Pink.111	09:54.4	09:58.5	"And then, yeah, seven I have as the thirty feet of rope."
11.Green.89	09:58.6	10:00.2	"Yep, we'll do that."
11.Pink.112	09:59.3	10:00.2	"Okay."
11.Pink.113	10:01.6	10:06.7	"Okay and eight I have the flashlight."
11.Green.90	10:11.0	10:13.7	"Do you want to do flashlight or the pistol?"
11.Pink.114	10:14.6	10:19.5	"Do you want to do the pistol for eight?"
11.Green.91	10:19.7	10:20.2	"Okay."
11.Pink.115	10:20.3	10:21.7	"Yeah okay."
11.Pink.116	10:22.2	10:25.0	"Loaded forty-five caliber."
11.Green.92	10:25.0	10:27.2	"Nine for flashlight."
11.Pink.117	10:25.5	10:26.8	"Nine."
11.Pink.118	10:27.3	10:28.6	"Flashlight nine?"
11.Green.93	10:27.9	10:28.6	"Yeah."
11.Pink.119	10:30.3	10:34.4	"Um, ten. I have the whiskey."
11.Green.94	10:34.9	10:38.2	"What do I have? Where is my ten?"
11.Pink.120	10:52.3	10:55.4	"Or I think the knife should become before whiskey."
11.Green.95	10:53.4	10:55.4	"Just the yeah just the whiskey."
11.Pink.121	10:55.4	10:59.2	"Okay, I would probably say knife is more important than the whiskey."
11.Green.96	10:59.3	11:02.6	"Um, we'll write whiskey, yeah."
11.Green.97	11:02.7	11:03.2	"Yeah."
11.Pink.122	11:03.3	11:07.3	"Do you want to do ten and then maybe eleven?"
11.Green.98	11:05.4	11:06.9	"Yeah okay."
11.Green.99	11:08.2	11:08.9	"Okay."
11.Green.100	11:10.2	11:15.4	"Um, we can -- why do we need cigarette like?"
11.Pink.123	11:15.4	11:18.6	"I know, I don't get -- especially without the fluid, I'm like I don't know what that."
11.Green.101	11:18.6	11:23.4	"If it's a lighter, we can use it, uh, whiskey as a fluid for this."
11.Pink.124	11:18.6	11:20.2	"Who knows, it could be."
11.Pink.125	11:24.2	11:25.4	"Yes that's true."
11.Green.102	11:25.2	11:30.2	"And then we can use newspaper to -- for heat [unclear] obviously."
11.Pink.126	11:30.2	11:31.1	"Okay."
11.Green.103	11:31.2	11:32.1	"Like to burn."
11.Pink.127	11:32.9	11:43.3	"Okay, do you think ball of whiskey -- sorry $ ball of whiskey, what am I saying -- ball of steel wool, um, do you think that would be the least, like fifteen?"
11.Green.104	11:37.7	11:39.3	"Whiskey."
11.Green.105	11:43.3	11:44.4	"Why do we need?"
11.Pink.128	11:44.3	11:47.8	"Yeah exactly, so it would be the least important, right?"
11.Green.106	11:47.9	11:50.6	"It might have something, like."
11.Pink.129	11:49.4	11:51.5	"Yeah I just have no idea."
11.Green.107	11:51.3	11:53.6	"Yeah [unclear]."
11.Green.108	11:54.9	11:56.7	"[unclear]"
11.Pink.130	11:54.9	11:58.5	"[unclear] to like clean metals, I don't know."
11.Pink.131	11:58.8	12:00.9	"So, do you want to do fifteen for this?"
11.Green.109	12:00.4	12:01.8	"Yeah okay."
11.Pink.132	12:00.9	12:05.6	"And so all we have then I think is twelve, thirteen, fourteen."
11.Green.110	12:03.7	12:11.2	"I think this should have been, um, before because it's ice and snow and we need to keep warm."
11.Pink.133	12:10.2	12:12.2	"So do you want to do twelve?"
11.Green.111	12:12.2	12:13.5	"Yeah."
11.Pink.134	12:14.2	12:16.5	"And then we have thirteen and fourteen left."
11.Green.112	12:16.6	12:20.3	"Um, this is, uh."
11.Pink.135	12:21.8	12:24.9	"These kinda like, I feel like they could --"
11.Green.113	12:24.6	12:26.0	"Go hand in hand."
11.Pink.136	12:25.3	12:26.1	"Yeah."
11.Green.114	12:26.5	12:28.3	"Yeah they could."
11.Pink.137	12:26.9	12:28.7	"So just the thirteen fourteen?"
11.Pink.138	12:30.0	12:31.0	"Okay that's it."
11.Pink.139	12:31.2	12:32.5	"Cool $."
