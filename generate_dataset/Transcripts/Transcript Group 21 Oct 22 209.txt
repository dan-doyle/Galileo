21.Orange.2	00:14.0	00:17.1	"Um, I just thought it was like an emergency kind of kit that has stuff in it."
21.Pink.2	00:17.4	00:18.5	"Yeah, that's what I assumed too."
21.Pink.3	00:18.5	00:22.1	"It's in my -- it's in my top um -- it's in my top few."
21.Pink.4	00:22.1	00:23.3	"But I didn't put it as a first one."
21.Pink.5	00:23.3	00:24.8	"But it is definitely important."
21.Blue.5	00:24.9	00:25.4	"Okay."
21.Blue.6	00:25.5	00:29.5	"So, what I had was the sectional air map."
21.Blue.7	00:29.7	00:37.7	"And my like thought behind it was because that's like you'll know where you are and you can find where the safety faster."
21.Blue.8	00:38.4	00:44.0	"Um, e-so, I have the air map and the compass as one and two."
21.Blue.9	00:44.8	00:55.4	"Um, after like I have like the map stuff, I have, uh, like things for fire, to start a fire."
21.Orange.3	00:55.4	00:55.8	"Mhm."

21.Orange.4	00:56.2	00:56.8	"Yeah."
21.Blue.10	00:57.3	01:02.7	"Um, well, actually I-I do have the extra shirt and pants as a third though."
21.Orange.5	01:03.4	01:07.2	"For number two, I had the newspaper just so I can like start the fire or something."
21.Blue.11	01:07.2	01:07.7	"Mhm."
21.Pink.7	01:07.3	01:07.6	"Yes."
21.Orange.6	01:07.8	01:10.2	"And then, for number three, I had the compass."
21.Orange.7	01:10.6	01:13.0	"This is, uh, see what area to go to."
21.Pink.8	01:12.9	01:13.4	"Mhm."
21.Pink.9	01:14.1	01:18.0	"Yeah, and I had up there too, um, the-the food that we have already."

21.Orange.8	01:17.9	01:18.3	"Mhm."
21.Pink.10	01:18.1	01:19.5	"I had that up there too."
21.Blue.13	01:20.9	01:24.9	"So, w-what do you guys want to decide on for the first?"
21.Blue.14	01:25.2	01:29.6	"I think we all have sort of like the general idea like of the same things."
21.Orange.9	01:28.0	01:28.4	"Yeah."
21.Pink.11	01:28.2	01:28.7	"Mhm."
21.Blue.15	01:29.7	01:30.2	"But."
21.Pink.12	01:32.0	01:34.4	"Um, maybe we should work backwards then."
21.Blue.16	01:32.0	01:32.7	"So, do you."
21.Blue.17	01:34.6	01:35.1	"Yeah."
21.Pink.13	01:34.7	01:36.9	"We all know what's at the top, maybe we should work backwards."
21.Blue.18	01:36.5	01:36.9	"Yeah."
21.Orange.10	01:37.0	01:37.3	"Sure."
21.Blue.19	01:37.9	01:41.7	"I put cigarette lighter without the fluid as last one."
21.Pink.14	01:39.4	01:41.7	"Me too $ me too."
21.Orange.11	01:40.9	01:41.5	"Yeah."
21.Pink.15	01:41.7	01:42.7	"Okay, I'll put that down."
21.Blue.20	01:41.7	01:42.1	"Okay."
21.Blue.21	01:44.2	01:46.1	"Cause that's useless $."
21.Pink.16	01:45.5	01:46.4	"Okay $."
21.Blue.22	01:46.9	01:50.9	"And then fourteen, I put ball of steel wool."
21.Blue.23	01:50.9	01:52.6	"I know it's good for starting a fire."
21.Blue.24	01:53.1	01:59.1	"But there's also the gauze, the newspaper, all that that you could start the fire with."
21.Pink.17	01:55.8	01:56.3	"Yes."
21.Orange.12	01:58.0	01:58.4	"Yeah."
21.Pink.18	01:58.4	02:00.0	"Yeah, I have that down there too, okay."
21.Orange.13	01:59.8	02:00.3	"Mhm."
21.Blue.25	02:03.6	02:08.0	"And next I have the eighty-five proof whiskey."
21.Pink.19	02:08.0	02:08.4	"Mhm."
21.Orange.14	02:09.0	02:09.5	"Yeah."
21.Pink.20	02:10.2	02:10.8	"Okay."
21.Blue.26	02:13.6	02:14.6	"And the shortening?"
21.Blue.27	02:15.2	02:15.7	"I don't know."
21.Orange.15	02:15.7	02:17.2	"I didn't know what that one was."
21.Blue.28	02:17.1	02:19.5	"I think like it's a thing for baking."
21.Pink.21	02:19.5	02:19.9	"Yeah."
21.Blue.29	02:19.9	02:24.2	"So, I don't think it would be very useful unless you could like sort of maybe eat it."
21.Orange.16	02:24.5	02:24.9	"Mhm."
21.Pink.22	02:24.9	02:27.5	"Yeah, it's like a kind of butter kind of. "
21.Pink.23	02:27.5	02:32.2	"So, it's not something you would like to eat, but if you're like desperate then yeah $."
21.Orange.17	02:30.5	02:30.9	"Yeah."
21.Blue.30	02:30.6	02:31.0	"Yeah."
21.Blue.31	02:31.1	02:33.0	"We can almost start a fire with it too."
21.Pink.24	02:33.0	02:33.8	"That's true, yeah."
21.Pink.25	02:33.8	02:34.4	"Okay, yeah."
21.Pink.26	02:34.5	02:36.5	"Okay, so should I put that down for twelve or not yet?"
21.Blue.32	02:36.5	02:38.1	"If you guys agree, sure."
21.Orange.18	02:38.1	02:39.1	"Yeah, you can do that."
21.Pink.27	02:38.3	02:38.8	"Okay."
21.Blue.33	02:41.8	02:46.9	"And then I had newspaper for eleven."
21.Pink.28	02:48.7	02:51.4	"Yeah, I had newspaper a little bit lower, I did that."
21.Blue.34	02:52.1	03:02.0	"Because I was -- my way of thinking is that the compress kit could be the, uh, um, the medical kit as well as the gauze could be used for fire."
21.Pink.29	03:01.7	03:02.2	"Mhm."
21.Orange.19	03:02.1	03:02.6	"Mhm."
21.Orange.20	03:03.0	03:04.3	"Yeah, that sounds good."
21.Pink.30	03:03.8	03:04.1	"Okay."
21.Blue.35	03:08.7	03:09.6	"Do you guys want to?"
21.Pink.31	03:09.6	03:11.3	"Then, I had the ski poles."
21.Pink.32	03:11.6	03:13.7	"Um, I know they are important to get around with."
21.Pink.33	03:13.7	03:18.3	"But um, for actual survival, I didn't think they were --"
21.Blue.36	03:17.1	03:21.1	"And they're in an area that don't quite need it."
21.Orange.21	03:21.5	03:24.4	"Yeah, I put that for eleven too, so I'm stuck on that."
21.Pink.34	03:23.4	03:24.6	"Okay $."
21.Blue.37	03:27.7	03:28.5	"What are we at?"
21.Pink.35	03:28.7	03:29.6	"Uh, we're at ten."
21.Pink.36	03:30.4	03:31.5	"Well, we just finished ten."
21.Orange.22	03:35.1	03:36.6	"Number nine, I put as knife."
21.Blue.38	03:36.9	03:39.3	"Yeah, but mine-my knife is ten."
21.Orange.23	03:39.1	03:39.5	"Yeah."
21.Pink.37	03:40.0	03:40.4	"Okay."
21.Blue.39	03:43.6	03:45.5	"Have you been crossing them off?"
21.Blue.40	03:46.0	03:47.6	"Just so we know where we're at."
21.Pink.38	03:48.3	03:49.0	"Wait, what?"
21.Blue.41	03:48.7	03:50.1	"So we're not missing any."
21.Blue.42	03:50.1	03:51.9	"I guess you can see that, never mind $."
21.Pink.39	03:51.5	03:54.0	"$ Yeah, I can see."
21.Pink.40	03:54.3	04:03.0	"Um... after that I had the... um, I had the pistol."
21.Blue.43	04:03.3	04:03.8	"Mhm."
21.Orange.24	04:03.9	04:04.4	"Yeah."
21.Pink.41	04:06.1	04:09.1	"Yeah, I'm assuming you can use that to hunt, but, um."
21.Blue.44	04:10.7	04:15.4	"I had that sorta up there with four because it is in the woods."
21.Blue.45	04:16.0	04:20.9	"And it's gonna dark soon, so there's like bears and stuff."
21.Pink.42	04:21.0	04:23.2	"Okay, so we'll leave -- we'll leave that one."
21.Blue.46	04:21.1	04:22.6	"[unclear]"
21.Pink.43	04:23.7	04:35.2	"Um, so what we had left is the chocolate bar, the air map, the compress kit, the pistol, the compass, the rope, flashlight, and the clothes."
21.Blue.47	04:38.2	04:41.4	"So, what do you guys think as like the first thing?"
21.Blue.48	04:42.0	04:44.2	"Like do you want to work from the beginning now?"
21.Pink.44	04:44.2	04:44.6	"Sure."
21.Pink.45	04:45.6	04:53.4	"Um... I'm torn between food and like warmth."
21.Blue.49	04:51.4	04:51.9	"Yeah."
21.Blue.50	04:52.6	04:53.8	"Warmth, yeah."
21.Pink.46	04:53.4	04:53.7	"Yeah."
21.Pink.47	04:55.2	04:56.2	"Yeah, so I'm not --"
21.Blue.51	04:56.8	05:02.6	"And it is like really -- there's lots of lakes and rivers so they might get like wet."
21.Orange.25	05:02.8	05:03.5	"Yeah, sure."
21.Pink.48	05:03.1	05:03.9	"That's true."
21.Orange.26	05:03.7	05:04.2	"Mhm."
21.Pink.49	05:04.0	05:06.3	"Okay, should we-we put the clothes first then?"
21.Orange.27	05:06.4	05:06.8	"Yeah."
21.Pink.50	05:06.8	05:07.3	"Okay."
21.Blue.52	05:12.1	05:13.0	"Hm."
21.Blue.53	05:16.6	05:21.7	"And then maybe map or the fire stuff?"
21.Pink.51	05:22.9	05:24.5	"Or the compress kit."
21.Blue.54	05:24.5	05:24.9	"Yeah."
21.Orange.28	05:28.5	05:30.9	"I was thinking maybe just the fire stuff, just so you could stay warm."
21.Blue.55	05:30.9	05:31.4	"Yeah."
21.Pink.52	05:31.2	05:31.7	"Okay."
21.Pink.53	05:31.9	05:35.8	"So, what should we put as number two?"
21.Blue.56	05:38.7	05:39.4	"Compress kit."
21.Pink.54	05:39.4	05:39.9	"Okay."
21.Orange.29	05:39.8	05:40.2	"Okay."
21.Blue.57	05:45.0	05:46.5	"Three."
21.Blue.58	05:48.5	05:49.5	"Air map."
21.Pink.55	05:52.6	05:53.1	"Sure."
21.Pink.56	05:53.1	05:57.1	"Yeah, cause then at least you know where you-whereabouts you are where you can go."
21.Blue.59	05:55.4	05:55.7	"Mhm."
21.Orange.30	05:55.4	05:55.7	"Mhm."
21.Blue.60	05:57.1	06:02.6	"And some people, they do know like how to like look up at the sky and like see if it's north or."
21.Pink.57	06:00.8	06:01.6	"That's true."
21.Pink.58	06:02.7	06:03.2	"Yeah."
21.Pink.59	06:05.2	06:14.0	"Okay and then, um, we have chocolate bar, pistol, compass, rope, and flashlight."
21.Blue.61	06:19.8	06:20.3	"Mhm."
21.Pink.60	06:25.1	06:27.9	"I think either compass or flashlight just to be safe."
21.Blue.62	06:27.7	06:28.7	"Uh, mhm."
21.Orange.31	06:31.3	06:35.5	"Um, I would say maybe flashlight just because it's kind of winter and it gets dark pretty early maybe."
21.Pink.61	06:35.9	06:36.3	"Okay."
21.Orange.32	06:36.1	06:37.4	"Considering it's winter."
21.Orange.33	06:38.7	06:40.3	"I mean I don't know."
21.Pink.62	06:43.1	06:46.4	"Okay and then, should we do the compass next or the pistol?"
21.Blue.63	06:47.9	06:50.6	"I think the pistol cause you do have a map."
21.Pink.63	06:50.6	06:52.2	"For, okay, for protection."
21.Pink.64	06:52.5	06:57.4	"And then, um, lastly, it's just chocolate bar, rope, and then."
21.Pink.65	06:57.7	06:59.8	"Should we do compass after the pistol?"
21.Blue.64	07:00.8	07:01.2	"Sure."
21.Pink.66	07:01.4	07:05.8	"Okay, so then it's just, um, rope and chocolate bar."
21.Blue.65	07:09.7	07:14.1	"Um well, there's not too much food unless you're like really good at gathering."
21.Blue.66	07:14.1	07:16.7	"So I assume maybe the chocolate bar and then the rope."
21.Pink.67	07:17.7	07:20.9	"Okay, yeah because at least it's something to start you off."
21.Blue.67	07:21.0	07:21.4	"Yeah."
21.Pink.68	07:21.6	07:22.6	"Something to eat first."
21.Pink.69	07:23.8	07:27.0	"Yeah and then the rope could be used for shelter obviously."
21.Pink.70	07:28.0	07:28.9	"Okay, that's it."
