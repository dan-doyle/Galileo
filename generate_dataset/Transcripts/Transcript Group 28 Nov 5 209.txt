28.Orange.29	01:59.2	02:04.1	"I did number one was an extra shirt and pants for each survivor and then --"
28.Blue.31	02:02.7	02:03.4	"Okay."
28.Orange.30	02:04.1	02:09.1	"And number two, um, was newspaper for each person."
28.Pink.15	02:08.3	02:10.0	"I have seven --"
28.Orange.31	02:09.1	02:14.9	"Just because newspaper is a good insulator, like you can stuff that in your clothes and it's can it's like --"

28.Blue.33	02:17.8	02:18.5	"Okay."
28.Orange.34	02:18.6	02:23.1	"And, uh, uh, number three was a compass."
28.Orange.35	02:23.1	02:31.7	"Because, uh, they knew that there was a, um, w-what does it say, next eighty miles northwest."
28.Orange.36	02:31.7	02:34.9	"So, compass would be helpful to know where northwest was."
28.Orange.37	02:35.6	02:39.1	"Like it's not number one because you can figure out northwest other ways."
28.Blue.34	02:38.2	02:39.2	"Okay."
28.Blue.35	02:39.2	02:39.4	"Wait --"
28.Blue.36	02:39.4	02:40.5	"Okay, so you have your top three."

28.Pink.16	02:41.7	02:45.3	"Uh, the knife, the compass, and the thirty feet of rope."
28.Orange.38	02:46.6	02:50.2	"Yeah, thirty feet of rope was fourth for me, or."
28.Blue.38	02:50.2	02:52.8	"Okay, so for me, my number one was a compass."
28.Blue.39	02:53.2	02:55.7	"Number two was a flashlight with batteries."
28.Blue.40	02:55.8	02:57.8	"And number three for thirty feet of rope."
28.Blue.41	02:57.8	03:00.2	"And four was a knife."
28.Blue.42	03:00.6	03:06.1	"So, I think we can all agree that a compass should be in top three."
28.Orange.39	03:04.2	03:06.9	"Compass is top three, yeah."
28.Pink.17	03:06.1	03:06.6	"Yeah."
28.Blue.43	03:06.7	03:07.7	"Um."
28.Orange.40	03:08.2	03:11.8	"Maybe just put it like behind compass, just do top three or something."
28.Blue.44	03:11.8	03:13.0	"So, compass."
28.Blue.45	03:14.2	03:28.7	"Um, I said flashlight with batteries because if you guys like like want to like keep moving, I guess when it's night, it'd make -- and even on like dark days in January like we all know like sometimes in like darker evenings it gets dark pretty fast."

28.Orange.42	03:29.4	03:30.1	"Mhm."
28.Orange.43	03:32.7	03:33.3	"Yeah."
28.Blue.47	03:32.9	03:35.0	"You can't really see in the dark."
28.Orange.44	03:34.9	03:37.2	"I say that should definitely be in the top five."
28.Pink.19	03:37.2	03:37.9	"Hm."
28.Pink.20	03:37.9	03:39.3	"I have it as four."

28.Orange.47	03:49.9	03:50.7	"I put it as eleven."
28.Orange.48	03:50.7	03:52.8	"But I kinda forgot about it."
28.Blue.53	03:52.4	03:53.7	"This is so stressful."
28.Pink.23	03:52.5	03:53.4	"$"
28.Orange.49	03:53.2	03:56.5	"I put gun and knife as ten."

28.Blue.54	03:57.5	03:58.2	"Yeah."

28.Orange.51	04:08.4	04:09.8	"Shirt, yeah."
28.Blue.57	04:09.3	04:14.9	"I don't think an extra wimpy t-shirt and a pair of pants is gonna do do much for you in negative forty-five degree weather."
28.Orange.52	04:14.5	04:17.1	"Okay, then I'd say newspaper is number one."
28.Blue.58	04:16.9	04:17.9	"Newspaper."
28.Orange.53	04:17.6	04:19.7	"Newspaper, one for person is number one."

28.Orange.168	13:37.7	13:41.7	"I think it's actually like a map of where the cold pockets are."
28.Orange.169	13:41.7	13:46.3	"So, like in this ravine, it tells you how cold it is."
28.Blue.196	13:46.6	13:48.1	"$"
28.Orange.170	13:46.6	13:49.9	"Could be, I don't know, it tells you the hot spots."
28.Pink.79	13:46.9	13:47.8	"$"
28.Pink.80	13:48.3	13:55.0	"Uh, I think, I think it would, I think it would have more to do with like the-the direction of the wind and yeah."
28.Orange.171	13:55.3	13:58.6	"Yeah but that would always be changing so if it's made of plastic."
28.Blue.197	13:57.0	14:00.4	"I was thinking that like a, like a, like a downward look at everything."
28.Pink.81	13:58.5	13:59.3	"Well."
28.Blue.198	14:00.4	14:01.5	"That's where I was going."
28.Blue.199	14:01.5	14:02.7	"But, probably wrong."
28.Orange.172	14:02.8	14:04.4	"Air to earth."
28.Orange.173	14:04.4	14:05.9	"$"
28.Blue.200	14:05.3	14:07.2	"Earth to earth ratio."
28.Orange.174	14:06.8	14:07.5	"Yeah."
28.Blue.201	14:07.3	14:08.5	"Um."
28.Orange.175	14:08.5	14:10.7	"Okay, no, I feel like where it is is fine."
28.Blue.202	14:10.7	14:11.4	"Fair."
28.Blue.203	14:11.4	14:12.7	"Are we all happy with it?"
28.Pink.82	14:12.7	14:13.3	"Mhm."
28.Orange.176	14:13.0	14:13.8	"Yep."
28.Blue.204	14:13.5	14:15.1	"Yep, okay sick."
28.Blue.205	14:15.6	14:17.9	"Now we're -- yeah, I guess."
28.Orange.177	14:15.6	14:16.3	"Done?"
