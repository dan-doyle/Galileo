2.Pink.6	00:11.1	00:11.8	"Flashlight."
2.Pink.7	00:14.3	00:14.9	"Okay."

2.Blue.7	00:22.4	00:23.4	"Cigarette lighter."
2.Blue.8	00:23.4	00:28.5	"I figure you can probably with your steel wool and your whiskey make some sort of fire."
2.Blue.9	00:28.9	00:34.3	"Cause alcohol is super flammable and steel wool is really good for making friction."
2.Pink.12	00:34.8	00:35.5	"Okay."
2.Pink.13	00:36.8	00:37.7	"We'll do that for three."
2.Pink.14	00:38.1	00:40.5	"Um, for four, I had a compress kit."
2.Blue.10	00:40.5	00:42.9	"I didn't think that was very important."
2.Pink.15	00:42.7	00:44.0	"But what if you get injured?"
2.Blue.11	00:44.4	00:49.4	"Uh, it's probably important then $."
2.Pink.16	00:44.5	00:45.6	"And you're bleeding a lot."
2.Pink.17	00:48.9	00:49.2	"$"

2.Blue.16	01:01.9	01:03.1	"Oh my whiskey."
2.Blue.17	01:03.1	01:04.5	"So that I could light a fire."
2.Pink.22	01:04.1	01:06.1	"Okay so then we'll do five and six for that. "
2.Pink.23	01:06.2	01:08.7	"So then it's worth having a lighter, right."
2.Blue.18	01:07.4	01:08.2	"Yeah."
2.Pink.24	01:09.4	01:10.1	"Um."

2.Pink.25	01:11.0	01:13.3	"Seven I had sectional air map."
2.Blue.20	01:13.8	01:18.9	"Okay we both thought a pistol was more important than a map so put that next."
2.Pink.26	01:17.0	01:18.6	"Oh yeah s- yeah."
2.Blue.21	01:18.9	01:19.9	"We're on seven?"
2.Pink.27	01:19.5	01:20.3	"Seven, yep."
2.Blue.22	01:20.9	01:22.1	"And then..."
2.Pink.28	01:20.9	01:21.7	"And then..."
2.Pink.29	01:22.2	01:24.9	"I agree with the compass being eight because you have eight."
2.Blue.23	01:24.5	01:28.0	"Yeah and then the map after that I think."
2.Pink.30	01:27.8	01:29.2	"So number nine for the map."
2.Pink.31	01:31.1	01:31.8	"Um."
2.Blue.24	01:31.7	01:34.7	"Sk -- okay ski poles seem really unimportant right?"
2.Pink.32	01:34.7	01:35.6	"Yeah."
2.Blue.25	01:35.7	01:38.3	"So why don't we put those last as fifteen?"
2.Pink.33	01:38.7	01:39.2	"Okay."
2.Blue.26	01:39.2	01:42.2	"And then like what would you do with a can of shortening?"
2.Pink.34	01:42.5	01:43.6	"I have no idea."
2.Blue.27	01:43.6	01:46.7	"Yeah so let's put that second last $."
2.Pink.35	01:45.1	01:45.6	"Okay."
2.Pink.36	01:46.6	01:47.9	"And even with the newspaper."
2.Pink.37	01:47.9	01:50.7	"I guess we can -- with the newspaper, you can light the newspaper."
2.Blue.28	01:50.3	01:51.4	"That was what I thought too."
2.Blue.29	01:51.4	01:56.1	"But I feel like there'd be other things you can light on fire like trees and stuff yeah."
2.Pink.38	01:54.1	01:55.8	"I guess you're in the woods and stuff yeah."
2.Blue.30	01:56.1	01:57.3	"And chocolate bars."
2.Pink.39	01:56.2	01:56.5	"Okay."
2.Blue.31	01:57.5	02:01.0	"I mean like they're sugar and that's sort of important but."
2.Pink.40	01:58.4	01:59.3	"Something to eat."
2.Pink.41	02:01.0	02:02.5	"I think we should have a knife."
2.Blue.32	02:01.8	02:02.8	"Yeah I agree."
2.Blue.33	02:02.9	02:04.0	"I don't know what number we're on."

2.Blue.34	02:05.6	02:07.1	"Ni -- yeah ten."
2.Blue.35	02:07.1	02:08.9	"Cause then we have eleven, twelve, and thirteen."
2.Pink.43	02:09.1	02:10.5	"Okay, I think..."
2.Blue.36	02:10.5	02:13.6	"Rope is definitely more important than a chocolate bar."
2.Pink.44	02:12.5	02:13.1	"Yeah."
2.Blue.37	02:13.8	02:14.5	"And then."
2.Pink.45	02:13.8	02:15.6	"Do rope then we'll do the chocolate bar."
