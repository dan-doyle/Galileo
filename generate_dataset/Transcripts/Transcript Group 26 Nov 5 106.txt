26.Pink.7	00:21.3	00:25.1	"Cause I put like compass and like --"
26.Pink.8	00:25.8	00:28.6	"Wait, what's an air map made of plastic?"
26.Pink.9	00:29.8	00:30.8	"Like a map?"
26.Orange.3	00:32.7	00:36.8	"Um, I was -- in my head, I thought just like a, a kinda like a tarp, like a plastic."
26.Pink.10	00:36.6	00:37.9	"Yeah okay."

26.Pink.11	00:37.9	00:39.0	"I put that as number two."
26.Pink.12	00:39.0	00:39.8	"$"
26.Pink.13	00:39.8	00:42.8	"But, yeah, no we can do the compress kit as number one."
26.Orange.5	00:41.7	00:42.8	"As number one?"
26.Pink.14	00:42.8	00:44.7	"Yeah, cause it's important."
26.Orange.6	00:42.8	00:43.5	"Okay."
26.Pink.15	00:45.8	00:48.2	"What did you guys put for the cigarette lighter without fluid?"
26.Blue.5	00:48.9	00:50.9	"Um, I wrote ten."
26.Blue.6	00:50.9	00:53.0	"I think more things are important."
26.Pink.16	00:52.6	00:54.8	"Yeah, mine was also ten."
26.Blue.7	00:54.1	00:54.8	"Yeah."
26.Orange.7	00:54.4	00:55.7	"Mine was fourteen $."
26.Orange.8	00:55.7	00:58.9	"Cause it's kinda useless without fluid in it."
26.Pink.17	00:57.5	00:58.8	"Yeah, exactly."
26.Pink.18	00:58.8	01:02.1	"I was thinking we could use it as some sort of tool, but."
26.Pink.19	01:02.2	01:03.1	"Um."
26.Pink.20	01:03.9	01:05.5	"Yeah, I don't know."
26.Orange.9	01:05.9	01:10.7	"Should we just go from, um, what would think like, from most important to least important?"
26.Orange.10	01:10.7	01:11.9	"It's easier."
26.Blue.8	01:11.5	01:13.3	"Yeah, yeah."
26.Pink.21	01:11.9	01:12.5	"Yeah."
26.Orange.11	01:11.9	01:13.1	"Instead of going down like."
26.Pink.22	01:12.5	01:14.1	"Instead of going in line, sure."
26.Orange.12	01:13.3	01:14.0	"Yeah."
26.Orange.13	01:14.1	01:15.6	"So, the first one we said compress kit."
26.Pink.23	01:15.6	01:16.3	"Yes."
26.Orange.14	01:15.7	01:17.7	"And then the second one, what did you guys think?"
26.Pink.24	01:17.2	01:18.8	"I feel like compass is really important."
26.Pink.25	01:18.8	01:27.8	"Because up in here, it said that there was, um, a town, yeah like eighty miles at-northwest so."
26.Orange.15	01:23.6	01:25.8	"A town nearby, yep."
26.Orange.16	01:26.8	01:27.8	"Mhm."
26.Blue.9	01:27.4	01:29.1	"We can do compass for two."
26.Orange.17	01:28.3	01:29.6	"Yeah I agree with that too."
26.Pink.26	01:29.7	01:34.4	"It's a long distance but you could make it [unclear]."
26.Orange.18	01:33.1	01:39.1	"And for number three, would it, um, I was thinking maybe it would be flashlight and batteries."
26.Pink.27	01:38.4	01:40.6	"Yeah, I also had that."
26.Blue.10	01:38.7	01:39.6	"Yeah."
26.Pink.28	01:42.7	01:44.8	"Um, what else, where are we?"
26.Blue.11	01:43.9	01:45.9	"Clothing for four?"
26.Pink.29	01:45.8	01:46.6	"Yeah."
26.Orange.19	01:47.1	01:50.2	"Cause then once you're making your way -- yeah."
26.Pink.30	01:48.2	01:50.8	"You can like layer up too, yeah."
26.Blue.12	01:49.3	01:50.2	"Yeah."
26.Orange.20	01:51.0	01:51.9	"Four?"
26.Pink.31	01:52.5	01:54.8	"Um, what else do we have?"
26.Blue.13	01:58.0	01:59.9	"We can do a knife for five."
26.Pink.32	01:59.9	02:00.7	"Yeah."
26.Pink.33	02:00.9	02:05.9	"Yeah they can use it to like kinda put it -- make something for a fire."
26.Orange.21	02:02.3	02:03.4	"Mhm."
26.Orange.22	02:05.3	02:06.1	"Mhm."
26.Orange.23	02:07.6	02:08.3	"Five?"
26.Orange.24	02:08.9	02:10.0	"And then."
26.Pink.34	02:11.3	02:14.5	"Should we do the, um, air map thing?"
26.Pink.35	02:15.1	02:17.9	"Cause we could use it I guess as a tarp or something."
26.Orange.25	02:17.0	02:17.8	"Tarp."
26.Blue.14	02:17.8	02:18.4	"Yeah."
26.Pink.36	02:17.9	02:19.1	"Yeah, for shelter?"
26.Orange.26	02:20.1	02:24.1	"And to help that, we-maybe the two ski poles to hold it up."
26.Pink.37	02:24.5	02:25.6	"Sure, yeah."
26.Blue.15	02:25.7	02:26.8	"What about like food?"
26.Blue.16	02:26.8	02:28.0	"Like can of shortening."
26.Pink.38	02:28.8	02:30.6	"I had that as my last one $."
26.Orange.27	02:30.4	02:31.1	"Me too."
26.Orange.28	02:31.1	02:32.2	"What is can of shortening?"
26.Orange.29	02:32.2	02:33.1	"It's not --"
26.Pink.39	02:32.2	02:34.4	"It's like, they use it in baking, it's like --"
26.Orange.30	02:34.0	02:35.8	"It's used in baking but it's not food."
26.Orange.31	02:35.8	02:36.6	"You know what I mean?"
26.Blue.17	02:36.0	02:36.6	"Mhm."
26.Pink.40	02:36.8	02:37.6	"Yeah."
26.Orange.32	02:37.4	02:39.6	"Cause it's bak -- basically kinda like baking soda?"
26.Orange.33	02:39.6	02:40.1	"Isn't it?"
26.Pink.41	02:39.9	02:45.9	"I feel like it's like... isn't it like fat or something?"
26.Orange.34	02:40.9	02:42.9	"A powder of some sort."
26.Orange.35	02:45.3	02:46.1	"It's fat?"
26.Pink.42	02:46.5	02:47.3	"Like."
26.Orange.36	02:46.7	02:48.1	"Then again, it's not very edible."
26.Blue.18	02:47.7	02:49.3	"I have no idea what it is $."
26.Orange.37	02:48.1	02:48.8	"Yeah what's more?"
26.Orange.38	02:49.3	02:54.2	"So, I would say -- so would you put sk-ski poll as seven to help with the thing?"
26.Pink.43	02:53.1	02:53.8	"Yeah."
26.Pink.44	02:53.8	02:55.1	"And then I think we should do rope."
26.Pink.45	02:55.1	02:57.1	"Cause thirty feet of rope is a lot of rope."
26.Pink.46	02:57.1	02:59.0	"And we can use it for lots of things."
26.Orange.39	02:57.1	02:58.4	"Oh, you --"
26.Blue.19	02:58.2	02:58.9	"Yeah."
26.Orange.40	02:58.4	03:00.6	"Would you put the chocolate bar before that?"
26.Blue.20	03:00.5	03:01.9	"Yes."
26.Pink.47	03:00.7	03:01.6	"No."
26.Blue.21	03:01.9	03:03.7	"Cause they need something to eat."
26.Pink.48	03:04.6	03:05.2	"I don't know."
26.Pink.49	03:05.2	03:09.2	"I feel like it'd be better to have equipment than to have chocolate."
26.Pink.50	03:09.2	03:11.9	"Cause that would only last for a short period of time."
26.Orange.41	03:12.0	03:14.6	"But at least it's like something, right?"
26.Pink.51	03:14.7	03:19.6	"They can eat like stuff on the, wherever they are, like $ they can hunt and gather."
26.Pink.52	03:19.6	03:20.6	"I don't know."
26.Pink.53	03:20.6	03:26.2	"I just feel like the chocolate bar would just be like a spike of energy and then you would crash and it wouldn't be sustainable."
26.Blue.22	03:26.2	03:26.7	"Mhm."
26.Orange.42	03:26.7	03:28.0	"What do you think about it?"
26.Orange.43	03:28.0	03:30.7	"Do you think chocolate bar is more necessary than?"
26.Blue.23	03:28.8	03:29.7	"Mhm."
26.Blue.24	03:31.1	03:33.5	"I think rope and then chocolate bar."
26.Orange.44	03:33.7	03:34.6	"Rope, okay."
26.Blue.25	03:34.1	03:35.0	"Yeah."
26.Orange.45	03:34.6	03:36.9	"We can do that, so eight."
26.Orange.46	03:36.9	03:38.6	"And then chocolate bar would be nine?"
26.Blue.26	03:38.7	03:39.3	"Mhm."
26.Pink.54	03:38.8	03:39.2	"Sure."
26.Orange.47	03:40.0	03:41.3	"Okay, nine."
26.Pink.55	03:42.6	03:46.6	"Uh, what do you guys think about the, um, the caliber pistol?"
26.Pink.56	03:47.1	03:55.0	"I was thinking like if they got closer to the village, they could use it as a way to like direct attention."
26.Blue.27	03:54.5	03:55.9	"Yeah."
26.Orange.48	03:54.7	03:55.8	"Mhm."
26.Orange.49	03:55.8	03:58.5	"And it's loaded so it's [unclear]."
26.Orange.50	04:00.5	04:08.6	"I don't think the newspaper for one $ person or the cigarette lighter without fluid would be much of a help."
26.Blue.28	04:08.5	04:10.6	"I wrote newspaper as fifteen."
26.Orange.51	04:10.4	04:12.0	"Yeah."
26.Orange.52	04:12.2	04:16.4	"So, would the whiskey be next after the pistol?"
26.Pink.57	04:13.4	04:14.3	"I had --"
26.Pink.58	04:15.4	04:16.2	"Hm."
26.Pink.59	04:16.6	04:20.4	"But I feel like with like making the fire you could use the newspaper."
26.Blue.29	04:20.4	04:21.0	"True."
26.Pink.60	04:20.8	04:23.7	"And also you could use the whiskey for the fire."
26.Pink.61	04:23.9	04:26.7	"I feel like we could put those two next."
26.Pink.62	04:26.7	04:27.2	"I don't know."
26.Orange.53	04:27.3	04:27.9	"Yeah, okay."
26.Orange.54	04:27.9	04:30.6	"So, ten and then eleven for whiskey."
26.Pink.63	04:30.9	04:31.5	"Sure."
26.Orange.55	04:31.5	04:33.0	"Cause we can also drink it I guess."
26.Orange.56	04:33.0	04:37.9	"And then twelve for the cigarette lighter without the fluid."
26.Orange.57	04:37.9	04:38.9	"Or is it newspaper?"
26.Pink.64	04:38.9	04:40.4	"Newspaper, yeah."
26.Orange.58	04:40.3	04:43.4	"And we'll put thirteen cigarette."
26.Blue.30	04:42.0	04:43.3	"Cigarette lighter."
26.Pink.65	04:43.3	04:44.0	"Hm."
26.Orange.59	04:44.5	04:45.6	"And then --"
26.Pink.66	04:45.3	04:46.1	"What's left?"
26.Orange.60	04:46.2	04:47.9	"Ball of steel and then shortening."
26.Orange.61	04:47.9	04:49.7	"Cause I don't think you can do anything with --"
26.Pink.67	04:50.8	04:53.3	"I don't think you can do anything with either of them $."
26.Blue.31	04:52.6	04:53.3	"Yeah."
26.Blue.32	04:54.0	04:57.3	"Steel wool you could use to like make stuff."
26.Blue.33	04:57.3	04:59.2	"But I don't know what you would make $."
26.Pink.68	04:57.5	05:00.4	"Yeah I don't know what you would make, yeah, to make."
26.Pink.69	05:01.8	05:03.0	"Um."
26.Orange.62	05:03.0	05:05.0	"Which one do you think is more important than the other?"
26.Pink.70	05:04.9	05:06.6	"Maybe the shortening."
26.Pink.71	05:06.9	05:10.7	"Just because I guess if they're really desperate they can eat it."
26.Pink.72	05:11.2	05:11.9	"$"
26.Orange.63	05:12.0	05:12.8	"Okay."
26.Orange.64	05:13.1	05:17.4	"So, that'd be fourteen and fifteen."
26.Pink.73	05:17.4	05:18.1	"Yeah."
26.Orange.65	05:18.3	05:19.2	"Okay."
