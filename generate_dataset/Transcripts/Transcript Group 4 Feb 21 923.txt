4.Blue.2	00:05.3	00:05.9	"%"
4.Orange.1	00:05.4	00:07.1	"I had the compass."
4.Blue.3	00:06.5	00:07.5	"Compass, yeah."
4.Yellow.1	00:07.0	00:07.9	"Yeah, same."
4.Blue.4	00:07.5	00:12.5	"Cause it says northwest, uh, eighty miles northwest of a small town, so like."
4.Orange.2	00:11.6	00:12.4	"Mhm."
4.Yellow.2	00:12.3	00:14.5	"They have to know like which direction to go."
4.Blue.5	00:12.9	00:13.8	"Yeah."
4.Orange.3	00:14.2	00:14.6	"Mhm."
4.Blue.6	00:14.6	00:21.9	"And then, I did a flashlight with batteries in case it gets like dark at night."
4.Yellow.3	00:20.8	00:21.3	"Oh."
4.Yellow.4	00:22.5	00:24.4	"I did that for number three."
4.Blue.7	00:22.6	00:23.8	"So they can see."
4.Orange.4	00:23.7	00:25.1	"I had that for three as well."
4.Blue.8	00:24.8	00:25.6	"For three?"
4.Blue.9	00:25.6	00:27.0	"What did you guys have for two?"
4.Orange.5	00:27.2	00:28.8	"I had the air map."
4.Yellow.5	00:28.7	00:32.2	"I had the extra shirt and pants just to keep warm."
4.Blue.10	00:33.1	00:35.0	"Okay, um."
4.Yellow.6	00:33.6	00:36.5	"But that's probably not as important."
4.Blue.11	00:35.0	00:36.8	"What should we do for number two?"
4.Blue.12	00:38.1	00:38.9	"%"
4.Orange.6	00:39.6	00:44.3	"Maybe do a flashlight and then the map because you would need a flashlight in order to look at the map?"
4.Yellow.7	00:43.0	00:43.8	"Oh yeah."
4.Blue.13	00:43.7	00:47.0	"Okay so two, three."
4.Blue.14	00:47.5	00:50.1	"And then %."
4.Orange.7	00:50.1	00:52.6	"Maybe the shirt and pants, yeah."
4.Blue.15	00:50.9	00:52.5	"The shirt and pants, yeah."
4.Yellow.8	00:51.5	00:52.6	"Mhm."
4.Yellow.9	00:52.7	00:53.5	"Four."
4.Blue.16	00:53.2	00:54.0	"Four."
4.Blue.17	00:54.3	00:55.7	"Um."
4.Orange.8	00:56.4	00:58.9	"For five, I had the compress kit."
4.Blue.18	00:59.2	01:01.0	"Yeah in case anyone's hurt."
4.Orange.9	01:00.6	01:01.2	"Mhm."
4.Yellow.10	01:01.0	01:01.9	"Yeah."
4.Blue.19	01:01.3	01:02.5	"Yeah you could do that."
4.Blue.20	01:04.0	01:13.4	"And then, I had a rope because it says like there's lots of rivers and lakes so like would be good to like get people across the lakes and the rivers."
4.Orange.10	01:09.8	01:10.5	"Hm."
4.Orange.11	01:11.1	01:12.6	"Across, yeah."
4.Yellow.11	01:13.6	01:14.6	"Yeah that's true."
4.Blue.21	01:14.6	01:16.2	"Do you guys want to do that for six?"
4.Orange.12	01:16.2	01:16.8	"Sure."
4.Yellow.12	01:16.2	01:16.6	"Yep."
4.Blue.22	01:16.7	01:18.0	"Sure, okay."
4.Yellow.13	01:18.0	01:20.8	"And the ski poles might also help with that or."
4.Blue.23	01:20.8	01:21.6	"Yeah."
4.Orange.13	01:21.0	01:23.5	"Or knife I feel like would be important as well."
4.Yellow.14	01:22.8	01:23.8	"Knife yeah."
4.Blue.24	01:23.5	01:28.3	"Yeah I put knife last on and then I realized it's definitely more important than number ten."
4.Blue.25	01:28.3	01:30.2	"So we'll do that one next."
4.Orange.14	01:29.8	01:30.6	"Seven."
4.Orange.15	01:30.9	01:33.3	"And then maybe the ski poles?"
4.Blue.26	01:30.9	01:31.9	"Um."
4.Blue.27	01:33.9	01:34.9	"Yeah we could."
4.Yellow.15	01:34.3	01:34.9	"Yeah."
4.Blue.28	01:34.9	01:41.5	"The thing with the newspaper, um, the whiskey, and the lighter, those can all start a fire."
4.Orange.16	01:41.2	01:41.9	"Yeah."
4.Blue.29	01:41.5	01:46.1	"Because the eighty-five proof whiskey can be used as fluid for the cigarette lighter."
4.Yellow.16	01:42.4	01:43.0	"Oh."
4.Yellow.17	01:46.1	01:46.8	"Okay."
4.Blue.30	01:46.6	01:48.4	"Right cause it's like flammable."
4.Orange.17	01:48.5	01:52.5	"But I also think that the family sized chocolate bar would be important, like."
4.Blue.31	01:52.2	01:53.4	"For food?"
4.Orange.18	01:53.0	01:53.7	"Yeah."
4.Blue.32	01:53.5	01:54.2	"Yeah."
4.Orange.19	01:53.8	01:55.3	"Just to maintain energy."
4.Yellow.18	01:53.9	01:54.4	"Hm."
4.Blue.33	01:55.3	01:56.3	"Mhm."
4.Yellow.19	01:55.7	01:56.3	"True."
4.Blue.34	01:57.0	01:58.3	"Um."
4.Blue.35	01:58.5	01:59.8	"Seven."
4.Yellow.20	01:58.5	02:02.0	"I would also say that, um, a can -- what is a can of shortening?"
4.Yellow.21	02:02.0	02:03.8	"What would that be useful for?"
4.Blue.36	02:03.6	02:05.5	"I think that's just for like food."
4.Orange.20	02:06.0	02:07.5	"I had that as fourteen."
4.Yellow.22	02:06.6	02:07.1	"Oh."
4.Blue.37	02:07.5	02:08.9	"I have that as thirteen."
4.Yellow.23	02:08.9	02:10.0	"Yeah it was --"
4.Blue.38	02:09.0	02:11.0	"Maybe we'll put that one later on then."
4.Orange.21	02:10.9	02:11.5	"Yeah."
4.Blue.39	02:11.4	02:13.9	"Okay, so we need eight."
4.Yellow.24	02:13.9	02:14.8	"Um."
4.Blue.40	02:15.9	02:20.8	"Should we -- like starting a fire might be good if it's that cold outside."
4.Yellow.25	02:17.6	02:18.9	"Yeah."
4.Orange.22	02:20.3	02:21.7	"Yeah, that's true."
4.Yellow.26	02:20.7	02:22.0	"Yeah, that's pretty important."
4.Blue.41	02:21.5	02:26.4	"So, I guess we would do eight as the --"
4.Orange.23	02:26.4	02:28.6	"Newspaper maybe?"
4.Yellow.27	02:28.9	02:30.7	"Or the whiskey?"
4.Orange.24	02:29.6	02:31.1	"Or the whiskey."
4.Blue.42	02:31.1	02:32.2	"Yeah."
4.Orange.25	02:31.8	02:32.4	"Yeah."
4.Yellow.28	02:31.9	02:34.1	"Cause you need the flame first like."
4.Blue.43	02:34.1	02:34.6	"Yeah."
4.Orange.26	02:34.6	02:37.3	"Do the eight as the whiskey, nine as the lighter."
4.Blue.44	02:35.9	02:38.7	"Newspaper can technically keep you warm, too."
4.Blue.45	02:39.2	02:41.1	"Like if you get that before the --"
4.Yellow.29	02:39.4	02:40.3	"True."
4.Orange.27	02:41.3	02:42.3	"Yeah that's true."
4.Orange.28	02:42.3	02:44.1	"Maybe do newspaper as eight."
4.Blue.46	02:43.6	02:44.3	"Eight."
4.Yellow.30	02:43.8	02:45.4	"Okay, whiskey."
4.Blue.47	02:44.3	02:46.3	"And then nine is the whiskey."
4.Orange.29	02:46.4	02:48.0	"And then ten is the lighter."
4.Blue.48	02:48.1	02:49.5	"Ten is the lighter."
4.Blue.49	02:49.8	02:54.6	"And then, should we do food next maybe or?"
4.Orange.30	02:54.4	02:54.8	"I think."
4.Yellow.31	02:54.8	02:55.7	"Okay."
4.Blue.50	02:55.0	02:59.0	"Cause if we have the rope, we don't necessarily need the ski poles right away right?"
4.Orange.31	02:55.4	02:56.4	"What about?"
4.Yellow.32	02:57.9	02:58.7	"True."
4.Orange.32	02:59.2	03:01.2	"What about the, um, pistol?"
4.Blue.51	03:01.5	03:03.9	"Yeah, in case there's like bears or anything?"
4.Yellow.33	03:03.4	03:04.0	"Mhm."
4.Blue.52	03:03.9	03:05.4	"Okay, um."
4.Orange.33	03:04.3	03:06.5	"I feel like that might be number eleven."
4.Blue.53	03:05.5	03:07.2	"O -- eleven."
4.Blue.54	03:07.5	03:10.3	"And then twelve would be, what, food?"
4.Yellow.34	03:10.2	03:12.1	"The chocolate bar probably."
4.Blue.55	03:10.3	03:11.6	"You think the chocolate bar?"
4.Orange.34	03:11.4	03:13.3	"Yeah I think that probably would be --"
4.Blue.56	03:12.0	03:12.6	"Okay."
4.Blue.57	03:13.4	03:14.8	"And then?"
4.Yellow.35	03:15.5	03:18.3	"Does steel wool -- what could that be used for?"
4.Blue.58	03:17.8	03:19.8	"Yeah, what's the steel wool?"
4.Orange.35	03:18.7	03:20.3	"I put that as fifteen."
4.Blue.59	03:20.3	03:21.6	"I did it as fourteen."
4.Blue.60	03:21.6	03:28.8	"My fifteenth was two ski poles cause I already had the rope."
4.Yellow.36	03:26.8	03:28.7	"The rope."
4.Blue.61	03:29.0	03:30.1	"Kay so."
4.Yellow.37	03:29.6	03:33.4	"It just might help with like walking up like-like hills and stuff."
4.Blue.62	03:31.4	03:32.2	"Twelve."
4.Yellow.38	03:33.4	03:36.7	"Like it's hard to walk in snow."
4.Blue.63	03:34.0	03:35.5	"Yeah that's true."
4.Blue.64	03:36.7	03:39.0	"Okay so should we do ski poles next, then?"
4.Orange.36	03:39.1	03:39.6	"Sure."
4.Blue.65	03:39.5	03:40.3	"Yeah."
4.Orange.37	03:39.9	03:41.4	"Oh, and twelve then?"
4.Blue.66	03:41.5	03:42.8	"Th-thirteen."
4.Yellow.39	03:42.8	03:43.6	"Thirteen."
4.Orange.38	03:43.2	03:44.1	"Oh okay."
4.Blue.67	03:44.5	03:47.6	"And then fourteen, fifteen between the shortening and the wool."
4.Yellow.40	03:44.7	03:45.2	"Yeah."
4.Yellow.41	03:47.3	03:48.1	"Yeah."
4.Orange.39	03:47.7	03:49.6	"I'd maybe do shortening for --"
4.Blue.68	03:49.2	03:50.4	"For food?"
4.Orange.40	03:50.1	03:51.0	"Yeah."
4.Blue.69	03:50.4	03:52.1	"Thirteen, fourteen."
4.Yellow.42	03:50.5	03:51.3	"Yeah."
4.Blue.70	03:52.1	03:53.4	"And then fifteen."
4.Blue.71	03:54.4	03:54.9	"Kay."
4.Yellow.43	03:54.8	03:55.5	"Mhm."
