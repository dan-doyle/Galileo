25.Pink.2	00:04.5	00:08.4	"Um, according to me, it should be compass."
25.Orange.1	00:08.4	00:09.2	"Mhm."
25.Pink.3	00:08.6	00:15.9	"Cause if we know where we are, we can easily, you know, go look for, yeah uh, rescue or something."

25.Blue.1	00:16.4	00:18.6	"But it's like eighty miles away."
25.Blue.2	00:18.6	00:20.6	"So that'd take like a day to get there."
25.Orange.5	00:20.4	00:21.1	"Yeah."
25.Blue.3	00:21.0	00:25.5	"So I was thinking like a pistol cause they're in like the middle of nowhere and there might be bears."
25.Blue.4	00:25.5	00:27.2	"$"

25.Pink.6	00:33.3	00:36.0	"Yeah, but they'll still know that where to go."
25.Blue.7	00:35.4	00:36.3	"Oh yeah."
25.Pink.7	00:36.0	00:38.4	"Yeah cause, uh, uh, what was your option?"

25.Blue.10	00:42.5	00:43.1	"True, yeah."
25.Orange.9	00:42.5	00:44.0	"I agree that the gun's important."
25.Pink.9	00:42.5	00:44.1	"Yeah, so."
25.Blue.11	00:43.7	00:45.8	"Yeah, compass is most."
25.Orange.10	00:44.0	00:46.5	"But I think the compass is the most important."
25.Pink.10	00:44.7	00:46.4	"Yes yeah."
25.Pink.11	00:46.8	00:49.9	"So, compass comes at like at rank first."

25.Pink.13	00:52.6	00:54.4	"What about second?"
25.Orange.11	00:57.5	00:59.1	"I said knife."
25.Pink.14	00:59.1	01:02.5	"Um, mine was a like rope."
25.Pink.15	01:02.9	01:10.4	"Cause I think, um, i-as you said like, it could take one day $, so maybe they need rope to build something."
25.Blue.12	01:05.7	01:07.1	"Yeah $."
25.Orange.12	01:05.8	01:06.7	"Yeah."

25.Orange.13	01:12.6	01:13.7	"I said knife."
25.Orange.14	01:13.7	01:15.4	"For the same kind of reasoning."
25.Pink.17	01:15.4	01:18.1	"Uh, what you gonna do [unclear] $."
25.Blue.13	01:16.9	01:19.6	"I wrote cigarette lighter without the fluid."
25.Orange.15	01:16.9	01:18.0	"I don't know."
25.Blue.14	01:19.6	01:21.1	"So the third thing was the whiskey."
25.Orange.16	01:19.6	01:20.4	"Yeah."
25.Blue.15	01:21.1	01:22.6	"So you can like light a fire at least."

25.Blue.16	01:24.7	01:26.1	"You could get cold."
25.Pink.19	01:27.4	01:29.1	"What is the final?"
25.Orange.18	01:27.9	01:29.5	"It's without the fluid though."

25.Pink.25	01:49.4	01:50.5	"Yeah."
25.Blue.21	01:51.4	01:52.2	"Would that work?"
25.Pink.26	01:52.6	01:53.5	"A whiskey?"
25.Blue.22	01:52.9	01:54.9	"Cause like it's eighty-five percent alcohol."
25.Orange.24	01:55.6	01:56.5	"I don't think."
25.Blue.23	01:56.0	01:57.1	"Would it?"

25.Pink.33	02:19.3	02:22.0	"There was like a ball of steel wool."
25.Pink.34	02:22.0	02:24.5	"Like there's no use of that either."
25.Blue.26	02:23.9	02:25.2	"That's a fire starter."
25.Orange.30	02:24.0	02:24.7	"No."
25.Pink.35	02:24.8	02:25.8	"Yeah."

25.Blue.34	03:07.0	03:07.9	"Yeah."

25.Blue.35	03:11.5	03:12.5	"Yeah."
25.Blue.36	03:15.1	03:16.2	"How about the ski poles?"

25.Blue.46	03:57.1	03:57.8	"Mhm."
25.Orange.44	03:59.0	04:00.3	"I do think the --"

25.Pink.64	04:08.4	04:10.9	"Yeah, so let's rank third."
25.Blue.48	04:10.5	04:11.1	"Yeah."
25.Orange.47	04:10.5	04:11.1	"Yeah."
25.Pink.65	04:11.9	04:13.7	"And then."
25.Blue.49	04:16.8	04:17.9	"A knife or a gun?"
25.Blue.50	04:17.9	04:18.9	"What would be more useful?"

25.Pink.67	04:21.4	04:22.3	"Fourth?"
25.Orange.50	04:22.4	04:24.1	"Depends what it's used for."
25.Blue.52	04:23.6	04:25.8	"I guess a knife you can that use for more things, right."
25.Orange.51	04:25.0	04:25.9	"Yeah."
25.Pink.68	04:25.8	04:28.1	"Okay, how about compress kit?"
25.Blue.53	04:28.8	04:30.7	"It says no one is seriously injured."

25.Orange.55	04:40.7	04:43.3	"I think flashlight's decently important, too."
25.Blue.55	04:43.0	04:43.6	"Mhm."
25.Pink.73	04:43.1	04:45.6	"Um, flashlight, yeah."

25.Pink.79	05:00.8	05:05.3	"Um, we can go like, uh, ranking of chocolate and whiskey."
25.Orange.59	05:05.7	05:09.9	"I think the fire things are more important than the chocolate and whiskey."
25.Pink.80	05:08.3	05:08.9	"Oh."
25.Pink.81	05:09.2	05:10.0	"Fire?"
25.Blue.57	05:09.3	05:09.9	"Yeah."
25.Orange.60	05:10.4	05:13.2	"Like the steel wool and the newspaper."
25.Blue.58	05:13.2	05:13.8	"Mhm."
25.Pink.82	05:13.8	05:14.4	"Ahuh."
25.Pink.83	05:14.4	05:15.3	"So."
25.Orange.61	05:15.3	05:17.9	"Would you just put those side-by-side or something?"
25.Pink.84	05:18.4	05:23.6	"So, you mean like we should go by a newspaper and steel wool."
25.Orange.62	05:24.3	05:25.4	"Yeah."
25.Pink.85	05:24.9	05:27.1	"$"

25.Blue.60	05:34.6	05:37.5	"I still think the whiskey would be a good fire starter, so."
25.Pink.88	05:35.6	05:37.5	"But it says like it-it's in the woods."
25.Pink.89	05:37.5	05:41.3	"Um, so what would they do with the newspaper if it's raining?"
25.Orange.64	05:40.6	05:41.9	"It's like a --"
25.Pink.90	05:41.3	05:43.2	"Because it's in with January."
25.Orange.65	05:42.1	05:43.9	"If it's raining."

25.Orange.66	05:45.1	05:47.5	"There's cover by the trees."
25.Pink.93	05:46.5	05:48.0	"Yeah, so."
25.Pink.94	05:48.1	05:51.1	"There would be no no use of newspaper."
25.Pink.95	05:53.9	05:59.2	"Or they can just $ um, use newspaper to just for fire."
25.Orange.67	05:59.0	06:01.1	"Yeah, that's what I mean, yeah."
