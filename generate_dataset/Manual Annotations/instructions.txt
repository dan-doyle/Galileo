Definitions insprired by: "Duplex Conversation: Towards Human-like Interaction in Spoken Dialogue Systems"

Interruption: 
When speech overlaps and the party wants to take the turn from the other, then we define the behavior as an interruption

Non-interruption:
Named backchannel -> (1) User has no intention to interrupt, such as greeting or backchannel 
Named noises -> (2) Noises, such as environment noises and background vocals, etc. 
Not applicable -> (3) Echoes, the robot hears its own voice and is interrupted by itself 
Misplaced speech -> (4) Misplaced-turn, the robot responds before the user has said the last word, which causes the robot to be interrupted by the misplaced utterance

Overlapped speech instances considered inspired by "Continuously Predicting and Processing Barge-in During a Live Spoken Dialogue Task" (Selfridge):
We do not consider cases where the overlap occurs in the first 300ms or in the last 10% of the previous utterance
